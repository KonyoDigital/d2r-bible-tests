## REG-006 — 2026-06-11 · v176 gambling section used `.drops` tables in the reference tab → broke v50 tier-count
- **Symptom**: Routine I (Playwright) shard 3/3 red on the v176 push (`670e33a`) and still
  red through v177 — 1 real test, all 3 retries deterministic:
  `v50_p_slider_explainer:41` (`expect(rows.length).toBe(4)` for the P# slider tier table).
- **Caught by**: scheduled CI full suite — NOT the 39-test pre-push smoke gate (v50 not in
  it). Reproduced locally (v50 + v176 together) = real, not tail-fatigue (failed on all retries).
- **Root cause**: the v176 Gambling section (Bridge B2) added THREE `<table class="drops">`
  (NPC / odds / what-to-gamble) inside `#tab-ref`. v50 counts `#tab-ref table.drops tbody tr`
  and assumes the P# slider tier table is the ONLY `.drops` table in the reference tab (it
  expects exactly 4 tier rows). Every OTHER ref-tab table uses `class="ref-tbl"` (Mercenary,
  Craft matrix, Breakpoints) — the gambling section broke that convention, inflating the count.
  The v176 spec only checks `#gambling-ref` text content (odds/NPCs), so it stayed green while
  the older v50 lock broke.
- **Fix (v180, commit pending)**: convert the 3 gambling tables `class="drops"` → `class="ref-tbl"`
  (the correct ref-tab convention; ids/content/`item-name` colours unchanged). v50 4/4 + v176 5/5
  green together; L_integrity 0. +6 bytes.
- **Prevention**: (1) The reference tab's table convention is `.ref-tbl`, NOT `.drops` — a
  `.drops` table there silently hijacks `v50`'s loosely-scoped `#tab-ref table.drops` selector.
  Use `ref-tbl` for any new reference-tab table. (2) A new section's spec asserting only its OWN
  `#id` text WILL pass while breaking an older spec that counts a shared selector across the tab —
  same lesson as REG-002/004/005: run the FULL `npx playwright test`, the 39-test smoke gate does
  not include v50. (3) When adding tables to an existing tab, grep `tests/` for selectors scoped
  to that tab's container (`#tab-ref table...`) before picking a table class.

## REG-005 — 2026-06-09 · v154 ref-header restructure truncated two test-locked section titles
- **Symptom**: Routine I (Playwright) shards 1 + 2 red on the v154 push (`f5dcb4a`) —
  2 real tests: `v50_p_slider_explainer:25` (expected substring "What the P# slider
  actually does") and `v112_binds_tierlist_droppool:77` (`refHasSources` regex
  `/Warlock bind .* Aura Enchanted .* sources/i` no longer matched). A 3rd red
  (`v41_deep_audit:324` calc "shako" search) was the KNOWN badge-interception flake —
  passed in isolation, NOT a regression.
- **Caught by**: scheduled CI full suite — NOT the 39-test pre-push smoke gate (neither
  v50/v112/v41 is in it). v50 + v112 reproduced locally = real.
- **Root cause**: the v154 first-glance restructure (single-line `emoji Title ▾` → rich
  `.sec-h-block` with title + subtitle) rewrote all 12 ref-tab `<h2>` titles. Two were
  SHORTENED for the bar: "What the P# slider actually does" → "…slider does", and
  "Warlock bind & Aura Enchanted — sources" → "Bind & Aura Enchanted sources". Both
  exact strings are LOCKED by older specs (v50 asserts the verbatim methodology title;
  v112 regexes the ref text for "Warlock bind"). The v154 spec only checks the NEW short
  titles ("Cube Recipes" etc.), so it stayed green while the older locks broke.
- **Fix**: commit restores both titles verbatim ("What the P# slider actually does",
  "Warlock bind & Aura Enchanted — sources"); the rich `.sec-h-block`/subtitle structure
  is untouched. v50 3/3, v112 7/7, v154 4/4, v146 (20 total) green; L_integrity 0; v41
  calc-shako passes in isolation.
- **Prevention**: (1) Restyling a section HEADER must preserve the exact title TEXT —
  older specs lock title strings as content anchors, not just structure. Before
  retitling, `grep` the verbatim phrase across `tests/`. (2) A new spec that asserts the
  POST-change wording will pass even as it breaks an OLD spec asserting the PRE-change
  wording — run the FULL suite, not just the new spec + smoke gate (same lesson as
  REG-002/004: smoke ≠ substitute for `npx playwright test`). (3) Shortening copy is a
  content change even when the intent is "just visual."

## REG-004 — 2026-06-09 · calc item-tile data-art-logo → decorateItemLogos dup + DOM-order hijack
- **Symptom**: Routine I (Playwright) shard 1/3 red — `v123_inline_item_logos`
  "Key of Terror has emoji fallback" failed (`r.fallback.length` was 0, expected >0).
- **Caught by**: scheduled CI full suite — NOT the 38-test pre-push smoke gate
  (which does not include v123). Reproduced locally in isolation = real.
- **Root cause**: v143 (`21a033b`) added a context-aware NAME hover to the calc grid
  by tagging every `.item-tile-name` (312 tiles) with `data-art-logo`. But
  `data-art-logo` has a SIDE EFFECT beyond the hover delegation: `decorateItemLogos()`
  consumes every `[data-art-logo]` lacking a `.d2art-wrap` child and PREPENDS
  `artOr(name, glyph, 'sm')` — with no `data-art-glyph` attr the injected wrap had an
  EMPTY fallback. Two failures cascaded: (a) every calc name got a duplicate glyph-less
  thumbnail; (b) calc tiles sit EARLIER in the DOM than the event-card cells, so
  v123's `querySelector('[data-art-logo="Key of Terror"]')` matched the empty-fallback
  calc tile first → `fallback.textContent.length === 0`.
- **Fix**: commit `dca9247` — calc tile uses `data-arttip` instead of `data-art-logo`.
  The #arttip delegation still reads `data-arttip` for the rich name-hover, but
  `decorateItemLogos` ignores it → no duplicate injection, no querySelector hijack.
  v123 5/5 in isolation; full suite 634 passed / 1 skipped / 0 failed.
- **Prevention**: (1) `data-art-logo` is NOT a neutral hover hook — it is CONSUMED by
  `decorateItemLogos` (auto-injects a logo). For hover-only intent use `data-arttip`
  (read by the same #arttip delegation, ignored by the decorator). (2) A `querySelector`
  that selects by a shared attribute picks FIRST-IN-DOM — adding that attribute to a
  high-frequency render path (312 calc tiles) silently hijacks any earlier-test
  selector. (3) A change to a high-frequency render path needs the FULL suite, not the
  smoke gate — same lesson as REG-002 (smoke ≠ substitute for `npx playwright test`).

## REG-003 — 2026-06-08 · per-charm Sunder recipe search misrouted to Bone Break
- **Symptom**: searching "renew black cleft" (and every other charm) landed on the
  Sunder recipe grid headed by Bone Break instead of the Black Cleft row. User: "when
  i search for black cleft it routes me to bone break."
- **Caught by**: user report (not a test — there was no per-charm routing assertion).
- **Root cause**: `openSunderRecipes()` was charm-agnostic — it only switched to the
  tools tab + uncollapsed the card, leaving all 6 rows collapsed (Bone Break first in
  the grid). The 6 per-charm recipe search commands (v133) all called it with NO
  argument, so any charm's "renew" intent landed on the same Bone-Break-led view. The
  charm's own MATERIAL card (openDrop) was always correct — only the recipe-tool route
  was generic.
- **Fix**: `openSunderRecipes(charm)` now expands + scrolls EXACTLY that charm's
  `details[data-charm]` row (closing siblings); per-charm commands pass `s.n`. No-arg
  call unchanged (opens card, no row forced). bible.html `9603dd3`.
- **Prevention**: v136_routing_audit_lockdown — AUDIT spec asserting every one of the
  6 charms routes to its OWN recipe row AND its OWN material card via both the direct
  fn and the global-search path (no sibling). Lesson: a per-entity action that takes
  NO entity argument is a latent misroute — when N search commands fan into one
  handler, the handler MUST receive + honor the entity key, and a lockdown test must
  assert each entity lands on itself, not just that "something opens".

## REG-002 — 2026-06-08 · reference tables reused class="drops" → tripped droptable integrity guards
- **Symptom**: Routine I (Playwright) shards 1 + 2 red — 3 tests:
  v109_binds_collapsible `all 12 binds sections` (count 12, got 14),
  v40_lockdown `zero empty chance cells in any droptable` (empty cells:
  tab-ref/9, /15, /20 = the FCR Note column), v50_p_slider_explainer
  `all 4 tiers present` (`#tab-ref table.drops tbody tr` ≠ 4).
- **Caught by**: scheduled CI run (push `aa6c300`) — NOT a local run.
- **Root cause**: the additive #tab-ref tables added across v112 / v115 /
  B3+B4 (bind sources, mercenary, crafted recipes, FCR/FHR breakpoints) all
  reused `class="drops"`, which v40 + v50 treat as a SEMANTIC boss droptable.
  v40 scans every `table.drops` for empty col≥2 cells (the FCR "Note" column
  is legitimately empty); v50 expects `#tab-ref table.drops` to be exactly
  the 4-row P# tier table. Separately v109 hard-codes 12 binds sections but
  v112 added the Tier-List + Aura-Enchanted sections (→14). All accumulated
  because v112–v118 ships validated SUBSETS, not the full suite, and the
  38-test smoke gate doesn't include v40/v50/v109.
- **Fix**: commit `e71e862` — new `class="ref-tbl"` (identical CSS, aliased)
  for the 7 non-droptable reference tables so the integrity drills only scan
  real drop tables; P# tier table stays `class="drops"` (v50's target).
  v109 count 12→14. 17/17 targeted + 56 adjacent + 38 smoke gate green; live.
- **Prevention**: (1) `class="drops"` is SEMANTIC (= boss droptable: item|tc|
  6-diff cells), NOT a generic table skin — use `class="ref-tbl"` for any
  reference/explainer table. (2) Adding a collapsible section to a tab that a
  count-spec guards (v109 binds, others) means bumping that count in lockstep.
  (3) Run the FULL `npx playwright test` before push when touching shared
  markup/CSS — the smoke gate is a fast-path, not a substitute.

## REG-001 — 2026-06-05 · artOr() lazy-load strip → calc-grid load storm
- **Symptom**: Routine I (Playwright) shard 3/3 failed — 3 tests red:
  v71_d2art `calc grid tiles` + `boss-nav chips` (assert `loading="lazy"`),
  v74_material_search `Colossal Ancient Statues header` (assert `loading="lazy"`).
- **Caught by**: scheduled CI run (push commit `4b80ba5`, headSha) — NOT a local run.
- **Root cause**: commit `4b80ba5` ("eager-load the 8 boss-card portraits" for a
  Safari rendering fix) dropped `loading="lazy"` from the **central `artOr()` helper**
  and the statue `<h2>` header — far wider scope than "8 portraits". That eager-loaded
  the hundreds of calc-grid item images (a load-time storm) and broke the tested
  lazy invariant in 3 places. **The commit was pushed to `main` without running the
  full Playwright suite** (the BULLETPROOF mandate) — that is the real gap.
- **Fix**: commit `74ae7f3` — restored `loading="lazy"` in `artOr()` + the statue
  head. Kept the 7 *targeted* static eager-loads Desktop added (Countess card header
  + 5 event-card logos): no test asserts `loading` on them, and those are the actual
  in-hidden-tab portraits Safari failed to render. 391 passed / 1 skipped local, green.
- **Prevention**: (1) ALWAYS run `npx playwright test` to green BEFORE pushing — esp.
  any edit to a *central* helper (`artOr`, `openDrop`, `switchTab`), whose blast radius
  is site-wide. (2) Editing a shared template means re-running the whole suite, not just
  the spec you think you touched. (3) CI (Routine I) is the backstop, not the gate —
  treat a red scheduled run as a real regression first, re-run the failing spec in
  isolation to rule out suite-tail fatigue (this one reproduced in isolation = real).

## REG-002 — 2026-06-08 · facet showcase + hidden-tier source-chip rank-first
- **Symptom**: Routine I red (push `a92b308` "Add Rainbow Facet …", inherited by
  `beda227`). 3 tests: `v81_colossal_jewels` showcase `.endgame-relic` count (was 11),
  `04_item_routing:44` (click source chip → boss) + `:79` (Esc clears active item).
- **Caught by**: scheduled CI (shards 1/3 + 3/3). Reproduced locally in isolation
  (`04:44/79` fail; PASS on parent `c6922e8`) = real, not suite-tail fatigue. NOTE: a
  concurrent CPU spike made local runs take ~19min — that was load noise, NOT the bug
  (clean runs are ~10-30s); always sanity-check `uptime` before trusting slow runs.
- **Root cause (two independent)**:
  1. v81 — `a92b308` added 8 Rainbow-Facet tiles to `#colossal-showcase` with class
     `colossal-tile endgame-relic`, so the showcase count went 11→19; the spec hard-
     asserted `toBe(11)`. (Intended feature, stale test.)
  2. 04 — LATENT since v87 (`a4d90d8`, "Hell-only view": CSS line ~107 hides
     `schip-norm/normtz/nm/nmtz` source chips with `display:none !important`). The
     aid-card chip bar still RENDERED those hidden tiers and ranked them fastest-first
     (`valid.sort` by hours-to-50%). When a NM-tier source ranked #1 for SoJ/Shako the
     first `.source-chip` was invisible → Playwright `.first().click()` timed out (a
     real user couldn't click it either). Surfaced on the `a92b308` CI run.
- **Fix** (render-only, math untouched): aid-card now builds `chipSrc =` the
  hell/hellTz subset of `valid` (falls back to all tiers if an item has no Hell
  source) and renders chips + count + "+N more" from `chipSrc` — so the first chip is
  always a visible Hell chip. v81 count assertion bumped 11→19 with a comment. New
  specs `v131_aggregate_jewel_links` (the user-requested 6-jewel links on the aggregate
  card). 04 7/7, v81 11/11, v128 4/4, v131 3/3, +84 smoke/adjacent green; L_integrity 0.
- **Prevention**: (1) when a CSS layer HIDES a class of interactive elements, stop
  RENDERING them too — a hidden-but-present clickable is a latent trap (focus/first-
  child/keyboard land on it). (2) A spec that hard-asserts a tile/row COUNT must be
  bumped in lockstep with any feature that adds to that container (v81 ↔ facets, same
  lesson as v109 ↔ binds in the BUG-above). (3) Sanity-check host load before trusting
  a slow/failing local run.
