"""THE MAP OF THIS SYSTEM, GENERATED FROM THE CODE SO IT CANNOT GO STALE.

★ Konyo: "we had a previous achilles project that we worked on with obsidian and we used blueprints
and reverse blueprints and DIAGRAM examples for future sessions and future and other LLMs working
on this repo. is there a way you can check it and also integrate that system maybe not exactly just
harness and extract whats needed for our current workflow".

WHAT WAS HARVESTED FROM ~/achilles-revival, and what was deliberately left there:

  TAKEN — the blueprint is GENERATED, not written. kai_blueprint_generator.py extracts routes and
          engines from the source after every backup, so the map cannot drift from the code. A
          hand-written architecture doc is out of date the first time anyone edits anything, and
          the version that is confidently wrong is worse than none.
  TAKEN — the REVERSE-blueprint doctrine, verbatim from KAI_REVERSE_BLUEPRINT.md: "Normal blueprint
          = design first, build after. Reverse-blueprint = audit what exists, map it truthfully,
          fix what's wrong... NEVER guess. ALWAYS trace." That is the discipline this repo already
          runs on; naming it makes it inheritable.
  LEFT   — the supervisord/SSH/proxy80 topology. That is Achilles' shape, not this one. Copying a
          reference's structure instead of its METHOD is how a map starts describing the wrong
          building. [[copy-drift]]

⚠ IT REPORTS, IT DOES NOT ASSERT. Every number here is counted from the tree at the moment it runs.
Where something cannot be counted it says so rather than printing a zero, because "0 lanes" and "I
could not read the lanes" are opposite facts. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
