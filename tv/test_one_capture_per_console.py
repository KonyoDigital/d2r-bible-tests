"""REG-1502 — ONE CAPTURE PER CONSOLE, AND A CAPTURE NOBODY OWNS LEAVES.

His words, 2026-09-29: *"my boosteroid app keeps crashing on me! something is related to the console i think"*.
MEASURED on the ALT that afternoon: FIVE capture_win.ps1 alive at once - four children of one console (10:23, 10:44,
14:31, 14:42) and one from the day before (22,052 s of CPU) - each PrintWindow-ing his Boosteroid window every 400 ms.
Windows logged a low-virtual-memory condition every ~5 min; dwm.exe died of memory exhaustion (0xc00001ad) eight
times in an hour and Boosteroid hung and crashed with it. The console's stop was a taskkill whose result nobody read,
and the spawn's "is one running?" check and its pid write were not atomic.

Four joints, each DRIVEN through the real function with the Windows edges stubbed (never a real process, never the
live tv/ pid file):
  · the spawn: two starts at once spawn ONE capture, and the capture is told which console started it;
  · the stop: a kill that did not land is counted and said, never assumed;
  · the boot sweep: ends a capture only when it is not ours AND its console is gone; an unreadable process table
    ends nothing and says UNKNOWN;
  · the capture itself (capture_win.ps1 Get-LeaseVerdict): leaves when its console is gone, its lease withdrawn or
    handed on - run in real PowerShell wherever one exists (Windows, CI), skipped by name on a Mac without one.

REG-1509 — the review of v3524 found six more, each now a driven case here:
  · THE STOP AND THE LAMP RACED. End Session stopped the capture while the mode still read 'live'; a status poll in
    between ran the lamp, which restarted a capture AFTER the stop - one holding its own valid lease, filming with no
    session (the reviewer drove it: 30/30 threaded trials). Replayed below through the real stop_agent,
    _force_kill_all_agents, _capture_health and _start_capture, in the three orders it can land in;
  · the sweep's query matched ITSELF (its -Command text holds the script path), so found/kept were one too high;
  · a console pid REUSED by a newer process read as the console being alive, so a day-old orphan was kept for good;
  · an UNKNOWN sweep read OK on the doctor, and a stop survivor warned forever after it had left;
  · a kill was judged microseconds after taskkill, and TerminateProcess is asynchronous;
  · this law's own spawn ran the unmocked priority step on fake pid 7001 - on Windows a pid's low two bits are
    ignored on lookup, so that opened pid 7000, which could be his game. The step is stubbed now, and a trap proves
    no priority call leaves the law (an odd fake pid alone would NOT have been safe).
RED_PROOF below.
