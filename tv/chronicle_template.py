# chronicle_template.py — v1690, THE MEASURED CHRONICLE TEMPLATE.
#
# Konyo: "every picture and screenshot taken within the chronicle feed... it needs to understand
# when the chronicle page gets opened and the template of the chronicle page is open... like a MINI
# version where we already have that has set parameters for this." This module IS that mini version
# for the Chronicle panel — a locked geometric template plus a detector that reads it, the way
# stash_eye's _TALLY_CROPS is the locked template for the stash grid.
#
# THIS IS THE TEMPLATE AND ITS PROOF ONLY (v1690). The three consumers — chronicle_retro.py (retro
# sweep), control_app.py (live closer), tv_diablo.py (live vision routing) — are DELIBERATELY NOT
# WIRED HERE. That is v1691, once this geometry has shipped and been read by a human. Nothing in
# this file imports or is imported by those three; grep for "chronicle_template" in them and expect
# zero hits until then.
#
# ── WHY A PIXEL PATH, NOT AN OCR-LINES PATH (round-1 correction #1) ──────────────────────────────
# Round 1 of this ship built `detect_from_ocr_lines`-shaped detection and was discarded: on real
# Chronicle frames with a found-item tooltip open (the exact footage motivating this ship), full-
# frame/worker OCR returns the TOOLTIP's text — "Required Strength", "Defense:", leet item affix
# lines — not "CHRONICLE" or "Unique"/"Sets". Even on a CLEAN panel, full-frame OCR barely surfaces
# the chrome at all; stash_eye's own tab-chrome path only gets readable text via a deliberate crop +
# 3x upscale, and even that stays fuzzy ("VNIQVE") rather than a clean token match. An OCR-line API
# would therefore return `tooltip`/unknown on precisely the case that matters most. `detect()` below
# reads PIXELS from the frame (same class of move as `control_app.py`'s closer, which already holds
# `fp` and calls `stash_eye.analyze_frame` for the identical reason — "full-frame OCR is dark").
# `detect_from_ocr_lines()` exists too, but only as a WEAK SECONDARY that can corroborate a pixel
# verdict in `why` — it must never be the production classify source and never overrides pixels.
#
# ── WHY THESE BANDS AND NOT STASH_EYE'S (round-1 correction #2) ──────────────────────────────────
# The Chronicle is a CENTERED MODAL, not stash_eye's LEFT-ANCHORED panel: title "CHRONICLE" · three
# tabs Unique | Sets | Runewords · a secondary Normal/Exceptional/Elite strip · a search box · a LEFT
# CATEGORY RAIL · a progress bar + "View Rewards" button · then the list. stash_eye's crops and its
# `x * cal_aspect/aspect` aspect law are written for a panel anchored at the left edge and cannot be
# copied onto a centered one without measuring first — which is how round 1 shipped invented
# fractions. Every band below was MEASURED by opening real frames from
# tv/frames/hist/reel_s_1786385768689_67392/ (native 2940x1912, the same calibration film stash_eye
# locked on) with vision and then reading their pixels directly (see MEASURED_ON below) — never
# derived by copying stash_eye's left-anchor math. Off-calibration aspects go through
# `_scale_band_for_aspect`, a DIFFERENT and CENTER-PRESERVING derivation which `geometry_signals()`
# ACTUALLY APPLIES to every x-band (`signals["band_branch"]` records which branch ran); it is
# explicitly labelled derived-not-measured, exactly as stash_eye labels its own untested 16:9 branch.
#
# ── WHY GEOMETRY IS GRADED SEPARATELY FROM VISION LABELS (round-1 correction #3) ──────────────────
# The 8 vision labels available for this reel are sparse and one of the eight is a conf-0.60 read
# whose `names` are literally `['Amulet'] * 7` — not clean ground truth. `test_chronicle_template.py`
# grades pixel geometry (measured, deterministic, reproducible from the source JPEGs) and the vision
# labels SEPARATELY and never averages them — grading a pixel template against sparse/low-confidence
# vision labels alone is how round 1 believed itself correct while its own detector flagged 30 of 31
# non-Chronicle controls AS Chronicle.
#
# ── ROUND 2 WAS REFUTED TOO. WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY (read this before touching a threshold) ────────
# Round 2 shipped a tab channel read off the SELECTED TAB'S GOLD BOX OUTLINE and an is_chronicle gate
# that was one signal wearing a template's clothes. A cross-family review ran it over the whole reel
# and broke it in three measured places. All three are fixed here, and the fix is a CHANNEL CHANGE,
# not a threshold nudge:
#
#   (a) THE GOLD-OUTLINE CHANNEL INVERTS UNDER THE OCCLUSION THIS SHIP EXISTS FOR. On
#       f_1786385904883.jpg the Unique tab is genuinely selected, with a "Radament's Sphere" tooltip
#       drawn across Sets/Runewords; the tooltip's gold item name scored 0.0415 in the runewords band
#       against the true tab's 0.0011 — 38x — so winner-take-all named "runewords", the one tab with
#       NO LEDGER PATH. Eight frames in the reel did this.
#   (b) SO DID TAB INTERIOR BRIGHTNESS, which was the obvious replacement and is MEASURED HERE TO
#       FAIL: on that same frame the tooltip scrim drags the true Unique tab to mean-luma 32.4 while
#       unselected Runewords sits at 34.9. Recorded so nobody re-derives it: brightness is not a tab
#       channel.
#   (c) THE ONE MARK THAT SURVIVES IS THE SELECTED-TAB MARKER — the small saturated BLUE DIAMOND the
#       game draws at the bottom-center of the active tab, below the tab box. It is the only
#       Chronicle chrome that is (i) positionally locked to one tab, (ii) a hue no D2R tooltip
#       chrome or gold text can imitate, and (iii) still legible through the tooltip scrim. Measured
#       blue-fraction in the marker window: clean Unique 0.0347, the SAME tab under the tooltip
#       scrim 0.0102, and EXACTLY 0.0000 on both unselected siblings in both frames. That is the
#       channel `detect()` now decides on. The gold-outline reading is kept in the signals dict as
#       corroboration for `why` and DOES NOT VOTE.
#   (d) A BLUE MARKER WINDOW CAN STILL BE POISONED — by the tooltip's own blue stat text. On
#       f_1786385826754.jpg the "Defense: (335-350)" line lands inside the runewords marker window
#       and reads 0.269, ~8x above any real diamond. So the marker channel carries an UPPER bound as
#       well as a lower one: a window above `_TAB_MARKER_MAX` is declared CONTAMINATED and cannot
#       win. That is the tab-band occlusion gate, and it watches the TAB BAND — not the far-right
#       search box, which is what round 2 watched while claiming to protect the tabs.
#   (e) is_chronicle NO LONGER RESTS ON ONE SIGNAL. Round 2's gate was `score >= 0.55` while the
#       close-X contributed exactly 0.55, so is_chronicle was literally "is there red in one
#       0.03x0.025 box" — a uniformly SOLID RED test image (tv/frames/hist/1_1785703546039.jpg)
#       returned True. `detect()` now counts FOUR independent votes and requires at least TWO, so no
#       single band can carry the verdict and list_midgray genuinely votes. The solid-red image
#       scores 1 vote and is refused.
#
# ── ONE MEASURED LIMIT, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED IN v1691 ───────────────────────────────────
# THE MARKER CHANNEL NEEDS NATIVE-RESOLUTION FRAMES. tv/frames/hist/ also holds DOWNSCALED 1440x936
# copies of Chronicle frames (2_1786385782689.jpg and five siblings — same aspect, 1.5385, so they
# take the measured-mac branch). On those, `detect()` correctly returns is_chronicle=True but
# tab=None: at 1440px the diamond is ~14px across and antialiasing pulls every marker window to
# exactly 0.0000, and the thin secondary-strip lettering falls to 0.0000 too. That is the module
# REFUSING, which is the right failure — but v1691's readers must feed the NATIVE frame, not a
# thumbnail, or they will get a page they cannot attribute to a tab. Not fixed here by loosening the
# blue test: loosening it is exactly how the tooltip's blue stat text gets back in.
#
# ── PURE LAW (asserted structurally by test_chronicle_template.py, the way chronicle_retro's
#    write-free law is asserted) ── this module opens frame files to READ pixels. It performs NO
#    writes, NO deletes/renames, NO network calls, and NO model calls of any kind. It cannot tick,
#    untick, or otherwise touch d2r_foundLog/d2r_setPieces or any ledger — it only ever returns a
#    dict describing what a frame's pixels look like.
#
# ── THE RUNEWORDS DEAD END (documented, not silently folded) ──────────────────────────────────────
# The Chronicle panel has THREE tabs, but the board/intake kind vocabulary only recognises
# "chronicle-uniques" and "chronicle-sets" — there is no "chronicle-runewords" ledger kind anywhere
# in this project today. `detect()` still identifies tab="runewords" honestly when the pixels say so;
# `ledger_kind_for_tab("runewords")` returns None on purpose, and callers MUST treat that None as "no
# ledger path exists yet", never as "fold it into unique or sets". Wiring a runewords ledger is out
# of scope for this file.
