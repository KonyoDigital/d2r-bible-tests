"""v3775 review B1 (REG-2296) - A RUN THAT DIES MID-WAY STILL FOLDS WHAT ITS GATES BANKED.

The fold of the deferred self-arming rows ran after the last gate. A gate that raised (Ctrl-C, an
OSError from the runner, a bug) skipped it: TV_SELF_ARMING_DEFER stayed set and the banked rows sat
in a scratch file nobody named. The gate loop is now inside try/finally; the finally pops the
defer, folds, and if the fold itself fails it prints the scratch path so nothing is silently lost.
