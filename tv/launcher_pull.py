"""A tracked file that matches the fetched update is not a local edit.

The running console already treats a file whose bytes match origin/main, CR
ignored, as an update (_matches_fetched_origin). That code runs only inside a
process that has it. The launcher runs first, from the files on disk, and used
to skip the pull whenever git status showed any tracked change. A restart then
left the checkout where it was.

This does not fetch. It reads the origin/main ref already on disk. A blob that
cannot be read is not an update. A history that cannot fast-forward is not
reset. Unknown stays unknown: the caller skips the pull.

Exit codes of --apply: 0 the tree is clean, or the changed files were the
update and now sit on that commit; 2 local work, or not a fast-forward, nothing
was reset; 1 the tree could not be read, or the update matched and the reset
itself failed. A failed reset says so. It is not an unread tree.
