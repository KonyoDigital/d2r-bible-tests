# REFRESH THE GUEST FROM LIVE — the one command, run on the MAC, no mouse required.

#   bash tv/sync_guest_api.sh --to-box   # ...and copy it to the box
#
# HIS BRIEF (GB-CLAUDE-GROK-PROFILE-SYNC): *"Keep/improve sync_guest_api.sh (Mac curls :17772 ->
# mirror) + CopyToBox into /workspace/tv-diablo-guest/api-live/ ... Document one command
# Elad/Diablo can run: 'refresh guest from live' without Mac mouse."*
#
# ⚠ IT DID NOT EXIST. The brief says "keep/improve"; a search of this repo and the whole home
# directory found no sync_guest_api.sh and no tv-diablo-guest tree — the box has the bridge, the
# Mac had nothing to feed it. That is why the guest VAULT renders every locker as "empty locker":
# not a bug in the vault, an absent mirror. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]
#
# ⚠⚠ READ-ONLY BY ALLOWLIST, NOT BY INTENTION. Every endpoint below is a GET that reports. The
# mutating doors — board_tick, chronicle_apply, vault_apply, vault_forget, session/delete,
# relaunch, restart, quit, update — are deliberately ABSENT and must stay absent: his brief puts
# "mutating vault possession from guest smokes" out of scope, and a mirror that carried a write
# door would let an eyes-loop change what he owns.
#
# ⚠⚠ AND IT SCRUBS. This repo is public and the brief says "No install ids, hostnames, tokens, or
# home paths". His /api/status carries an install id, a .local hostname, a unix user and absolute
# home paths; fixture packs and evidence screenshots are built from this mirror. guest_profile.py
# does the redaction and the run REFUSES to copy anything that still leaks.
