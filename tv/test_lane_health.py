    one question short. MEASURED on his console 2026-09-17, in the sentence the heart LEADS with:

        9 reel(s) still on disk need a vault sweep — chronicle read them, vault never sealed
        them ... Sweep vault to free them.

    Asked of `reel_retention.plan()`, all nine:   4 test-fixture, 5 recent.
    Asked of the vault lane itself (`_vault_owed_reels`): it owes **3**, and NOT ONE of them is
    in the nine. The panel prescribed a sweep the lane owes for none of the reels named, and
    following it is the 2026-09-01 incident the retention rules exist to prevent — a queue of 26
    reels, 10 explicitly held, up to 97 paid reads.

    The count was right and the WORD OVER IT had stopped being true. [[label-outlived-referent]]

    line of carelessness away from being swept into the held-by-design bucket and never seen.
