"""#41 rank 22 (REG-1564) — WHAT EACH PC'S CHARACTER PICKER OFFERS REACHES THE FLEET, BESIDE WHAT ITS OWN DATABASE HOLDS.

The heart audit's rank 22: nothing on any PC reported what the character picker offers. His ALT showed an empty
picker for every mule slot for days (#174 v-B4) and no row anywhere carried the number - the picker's offer was
measured by nobody. Four joints, each built here WITH its law, each driven for real with only the edges stubbed:

  1. THE BOARD (bible.html) - `window._cbPickerCensus('tors')`, read-only: `offers` is the picker's Base Items rows
     for the Body Armor slot counted by DRIVING the picker's own list function (_cbRowsFor, cut out of _cbPickRows so
     the picker and the census share one list), `holds` is the same page's type table counting the slot on its own
     (every spawnable base whose type is `tors` or folds to it through ty[code][4] ancestry - the JSON's structure,
     never the rail the picker reads), `all` the rows of the tab the picker opens on. st.pick is never touched and
     nothing renders. An unreadable database is ok:false with a why and null counts - never 0. The board's own tally
     tick (window.__tallyPersist) hands it to the console in the same POST as the counts, inside the http(s) guard.
  2. THE CONSOLE (control_app) - /api/board_tally banks it (accept_handed_picker -> board_picker.json) BEFORE and
     independently of the counts, shaped and never re-derived; a garbled census is refused and never lands on a good
     one; `_picker_for_wire` reads it back with its own age; the beacon posts it per PC as `picker`.
  3. THE WORKER (functions/api/console.js) - the fixed key list keeps it (the seventh-joint shape `tally` names four
     times): counts clamped, words checked, an `ok` census without counts turned to ok:false, absent kept absent.
  4. THE FLEET (control_app /api/fleet, control_ui.html, console_doctor) - every peer's census rides through and his
     own row reads the local file (as the tally does, v2760); the click box prints 'picker offers N bases · database
     holds M' per PC, UNKNOWN in words when unread or an older build, a red 'picker short' word on the row ONLY when
     the two disagree; the doctor row 'picker census' goes MISSING naming the PC when any PC's two numbers disagree,
     UNKNOWN when a PC has not reported or the roster was never asked, OK when every PC agrees.

THE CORROBORATION IS RENDERER-AGAINST-DATA, said plainly: both numbers come from one JSON block, through two routes
(the list function with its rail, class rule, spawnable flag and dedupe; the type table's ancestry alone). The
baseline below tampers the rail in the fixture and watches the two sides part - the pair CAN disagree, so an
agreement is a measurement. Measured on the shipped block: tors 45 / 45 (134 rows in all), glov 15 / 15, belt 15 / 15.
`head` is NOT a comparable slot (its key is also the voodoo-heads type code), which is why the wire carries `tors`.

⚠ NOTHING REAL IS TOUCHED: the banked files are pointed into a temp dir, the beacon's network and state file are
stubbed, the worker runs in node over an in-memory KV, the card's helpers run in node over fixture rows. No console,
no window, no network. PROOF_NEEDS brings the worker and its import into heart2's sandbox. RED_PROOF below.
