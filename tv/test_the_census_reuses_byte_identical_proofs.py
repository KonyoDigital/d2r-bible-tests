"""#186 - THE SELF-PROVE CENSUS SERVES A PROOF BANKED OVER BYTE-IDENTICAL INPUTS, AND BANKS WHAT IT PROVES.

His ruling, 2026-10-28: "NO IT DOESNT NEED TO PROVE ITSELF. it can accept a proof earned on byte identical ... it should
work with that same recipe". Measured the night before: a push banks its PROVENs in the machine's verdict cache, and
then the census on the same PC re-proved those very laws from scratch (test_control: 27 proofs, ~92 minutes), while the
river stayed locked behind it. The census path (_prove_gates) never opened the cache; only prove(push=True) did.

Now `heart2.py --prove ... --reuse` - the self-prove lane's census, and only it - opens the cache: each proof is served
over byte-identical inputs through _cache_serve (the push's own rule, the same function) or run as the census always
ran it and banked through _cache_bank once its gate's closing clean run has kept it PROVEN. A proof needing what this
PC lacks is never served. A served gate keeps the age it was MEASURED at. A plain --prove (run_gates, CI, a hand run)
never opens it. The lane reads the prover's own served/banked line back (None until a run has said it).

EVERYTHING HERE IS A FIXTURE: the P3 law's throwaway repo, its ten-line law and a cache file beside it.
