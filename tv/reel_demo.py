"""A DEMONSTRATION ON HIS REAL REELS — did they go through, and does downstream still agree?

Konyo, 2026-09-04: *"do tests on the reels see that they get run and proccesed through the printer
and everything down stream correctly as it was registered before.. chronicles and all the
readers.. everytinh was working before.. so it needs to be tested too"*, then *"simulations",
"demonstrations", "based on real reels", "ingame", "those same reels", "see that they got
proccsed logically coded"*.

⚠⚠ THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION, NOT A UNIT TEST, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE POINT. The suites already
assert behaviour against fixtures. What nothing did was take HIS OWN FOOTAGE, walk it through the
pipeline that has been rebuilt underneath it over nine versions, and show — reel by reel — that
every station still answers and that the numbers downstream are the ones that were registered
before any of it changed.

★ IT ASSERTS AGAINST REGISTERED VALUES, NOT AGAINST ITSELF. `route_totals` is the one source for
runewords/sets/uniques, each carrying his own ruling; a demonstration that re-derived them from
the same code it is testing would agree with itself and prove nothing. [[feedback-verify-not-proxy]]

★ AND IT NEVER WRITES. No seal, no ledger, no tombstone, no prune. It reads and it reports.
