"""🎞🏦 A SEAL IS NOT AN EXTRACTION, AND A CHRONICLE VERDICT CANNOT SPEAK FOR STASH FOOTAGE.

Konyo, 2026-09-10: *"all of the reels get extracted with information thats needed.. whatever doesn
have information on the reels get filtered anyways and go to tombstone eventually within the
filtering system and process"* — and, on the order: *"properly getting filtered and extracted"*
BEFORE the tombstone.

Two rules ship together here, and they are each other's safety.

⚠⚠ 1. `zero-pages` HELD REELS FOR AN EVENT THAT CANNOT HAPPEN.
Its sentence is "the engine reopens these when the prompt improves" — right for footage that HAS a
Chronicle screen the reader failed to read, meaningless for footage that has none.

    MEASURED on his 41 reels, 2026-09-10:
        held as   zero-pages 25 · test-fixture 8 · recent 8      (vault-owes NEVER reached)
        2,437 panel frames, 36% of all footage
        stash 1855 · shared 407 · personal 121 · materials 40 · runes 10 · gems 4
        chronicle: ZERO — and across all 454 surveyed reels in his store, never once

`retro_triage.PANEL_KINDS` carries 'chronicle', so the survey CAN say it and never has. Those reels
are stash footage held by a chronicle verdict, and `vault-owes` — the rule that would claim them —
is never reached because `zero-pages` matches first. reel_retention predicted exactly this: *"the
vault-owes tag genuinely never fires on his tree because earlier rules match first... a LATENT
defect the day a reel legitimately reaches it."*

⚠⚠ 2. AND LIFTING THAT HOLD EXPOSED ELEVEN REELS THE CHAIN CALLED FINISHED.
The moment `zero-pages` stopped matching, eleven reels came back as *"sealed by BOTH lanes — it has
given up its information"*. They had not:

    reel_s_1787508759592_46621   73 panels in  80 frames   148 MB
    reel_s_1787512325134_62795   64 panels in  67 frames   124 MB
    reel_s_1788105158696_89699   49 panels in  49 frames    88 MB

A vault SEAL existed for each with ZERO rows behind it, and the vault lane has never run
(reads: 0). `rows-not-banked` could not catch them — it fires only when rows EXIST and are not
durable, never when the count is zero and the panels are real. **A seal that records nothing is not
an extraction.** `panels-never-banked` is that missing case, and it sits BEFORE `rows-not-banked`
because it is the same lane at a different count.

MEASURED after both rules:
    41 on disk · 34 kept · 7 candidates
    held: test-fixture 8 · panels-never-banked 18 · recent 8
    every one of the 7 survivors: panels on film AND rows durable — genuinely extracted

    ⚠⚠ v2875 — FIXTURE, NOT HIS FOOTAGE, AND THAT IS WHY THIS GATE CAN BE PROVEN AT ALL.
    The first cut read `frames/hist` directly. MEASURED: a heart2 sandbox has NO frames/hist —
    `safe_copy` carries the JSON stores and deliberately leaves the 6 GB of film behind — so
    `plan()` returned ok:False, three of five laws called skipTest, and both red-proofs came back
    BLIND. heart2's own verdict named it exactly: "3 of 5 law(s) SKIPPED, but the other 2 DID run
    and stayed green — so the law IS weak, and separately some laws opted out."

    `TV_HIST` redirects `retro_triage._store_path()`, and v2750 made `plan()` read the CALLER's
    chronicle_swept/vault_swept out of its hist_dir rather than the live ones. So a shelf built
    here is answered by stores built here, and the laws run on every machine.
