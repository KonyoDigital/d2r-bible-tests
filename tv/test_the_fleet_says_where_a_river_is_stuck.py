"""#74 — THE FLEET SAYS WHERE A PC'S RIVER IS STUCK, AND WHY (REG-1461).

His ask 2026-09-29, after the ALT was found with 76 reels at EMPTY and 25 at PRINTER for two days and nothing
on any screen said so: *"we need to be able to see that deans console is also architectured correctly ...
see whats getting updated/fetched and logged and registered live while hes on playing"* - step 1, the alarm.

Three joints, each driven, never grepped:
  · the console: `_river_stuck_for_wire` over stamp rows - ONE rule for every reel on the shelf (REG-1812):
    inside the newest KEEP_RECENT a reel at a station a lane owns that waited > 6 h is named with that
    station's own reason (CAPTURE waits by design, ROUTED is kept); PAST the window every station owes the
    drain, counted from the later of its arrival and its exit from the window, marked window False; an
    unreadable log is None, never "flowing"; a console that has not computed its river does not walk the log.
  · the worker (functions/api/console.js, the REAL shaper in node): stuck/heart cross shaped - bad keys
    dropped, text scrubbed of paths; null stays null; absent stays absent.
  · the card (control_ui.html, the REAL _fleetSysParts / _fleetStuckChip in node): a red "river stuck" on the
    row, the stations with their age in the detail, "none" when it drains, UNKNOWN when it cannot say.
    A proof that is missing, stale or unreadable is "locks shut" on that same row, and a null stuck list or a
    null census is "river UNKNOWN" — not the empty chip a draining river uses. The verdict hover keeps both sentences.
    A presence key older than two refreshes plus one beacon is not "here": the dot is silent and the words
    say presence UNKNOWN, never ON AIR.
    A restart the console could not ask about is not "clear to restart": may null says UNKNOWN and keeps
    the why, and that sentence is the pending span's text because the hover strips titles.
    A pull git could not answer is not a pull that is fine: can null says pull UNKNOWN and keeps the why
    in the span's text. can false stays not pulling. can true stays quiet. No pull object stays quiet.
    A reel the router could not place is not the whole river: unknown and shelf ride with the stations,
    the line names unplaced and a gap against that shelf, a zero map over a shelf that holds reels is
    not called empty, and a change in either count is news. A missing count stays off the wire.
RED_PROOF below.
