"""REG-2364 — A SANDBOX BUILT FROM A WORKTREE CARRIES A HISTORY OF ITS OWN, AND NO DOOR BACK TO THE REAL REPO.

⚠ WHAT IT COST. heart2 proves a law in a sandbox: a copy of tv/ plus what the gates declare in PROOF_NEEDS, and
`../.git` is declared, so every sandbox carries a git history. From his MAIN checkout `.git` is a directory and comes
across as a private clone. From a LINKED WORKTREE - where every push now starts - `.git` is a one-line pointer into the
real repo, and make_sandbox rightly refuses to copy a pointer (a door), so the sandbox had NO history at all. Nobody
saw it, because git exports GIT_DIR into a pre-push hook from a worktree (MEASURED on git 2.50: from a worktree
GIT_DIR=<main>/.git/worktrees/<name>, from the main checkout none) and the hook passed it on: every git call a law made
in the sandbox answered from - and could write - the real worktree. REG-2360 made the hook unset it. MEASURED on that
branch, a sandbox from the worktree answered `git rev-parse HEAD` with "not a git repository": test_control's
relaunch case (TestV2153) ERRORED, so its clean run is red and a push that proves test_control is refused; and the
version-stamp law's red-proof [7] went BLIND, because its only catcher (RoutineIOnRealHistory) skips without history.

THE FIX (heart2._share_history, called by make_sandbox for a pointer and off the Mac for a directory): a private
`git clone --shared --no-checkout` of that checkout - HEAD is the worktree's HEAD, the objects are borrowed read-only
through alternates, the refs, index and config are the sandbox's own - made with no GIT_* variable in its environment
(a leaked GIT_DIR made its `read-tree HEAD` rewrite the REAL worktree's index, MEASURED on a fixture), and with the
clone's push url pointed at nothing, because its origin IS the real checkout.

REG-2396 / REG-2397 (the cross-family review of Push A2, 2026-10-22). The history was the sandbox's own; the LAW RUNS
were not. heart2 dropped GIT_* in 2 routines (5 of its 9 spawn calls): _run_gate_once copied the prover's environment
whole into every law it ran, and its own key questions (`git -C REPO ...`, `ls-files`) ran under whatever the caller
held - and a leaked GIT_DIR beats -C. So a prove started by an OLD hook (a push runs the hook file in his MAIN checkout, the one
origin/main had) or by hand inside one ran every law against the real repo and keyed proofs on another tree's files.
Now every process heart2 starts takes its environment from ONE helper, run_gates.git_free_env - EVERY GIT_*, not git's
--local-env-vars - which run_gates.law_env applies to every gate run, and suite_verdict, shard_suite and gate_ledger use
it for the suites and the git questions they start. And a Mac sandbox of the MAIN checkout, an APFS copy of its whole
.git, kept HIS remotes - origin is GitHub, the PUBLIC repo - so every remote's push is shut there too (_shut_push, one
routine with the clone's).

These cases build a FIXTURE - a main repo and a linked worktree one commit ahead, with a staged entry in the worktree's
index - and drive heart2.make_sandbox for real with heart2.REPO pointed at it, the registered gates' own declarations,
and GIT_DIR=<the worktree's git dir> in the prover's environment, exactly as a hook leaks it. They read the history in
the sandbox the way the two casualties do (`git -C <root> rev-parse HEAD`, `git cat-file -e <old commit>`), then try
every write a law could make in there and require the fixture to be byte-for-byte what it was.
