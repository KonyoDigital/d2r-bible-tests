"""#50 — EVERY PC PROVES ITS OWN INSTRUMENTS, IN THE BACKGROUND, WITHOUT BEING ASKED (REG-1447).

His ruling, 2026-09-29: *"i think it does need to get proved on the windows alt right? and on deans?"*
Measured the same morning, it does. A heart census proves that THIS machine's gates can still go red, and
the Mac's proof does not speak for Windows:
  · at the same clean commit the ALT's gate fingerprint was 2d9eff1d against the Mac's 56b2a8c3 - on
    Windows run_gates would not even import (REG-1445), and with that fixed it lists 679 gates to 678;
  · a one-law trial prove on the ALT found the river-outlet law BLIND there (green through its own
    sabotage) while it goes red on the Mac - the Mac's sandbox happened to carry one of HIS reels.

So the census is per-machine, and until today only the pre-push gate on his Mac ever wrote one. Every
other PC - the ALT, Dean's - had `.heart2.json` absent, so `self_arming.may()` answered "the heart has
never run here" and every lock stayed shut: 76 ALT reels at EMPTY never ROUTED.

This lane closes that. On an INSTALLED console (clean tree, at its upstream) whose census is absent or
stale for the gates now on disk, it starts `heart2.py --prove` in the background - hidden, at the lowest
ordinary priority, one lane - but only while the machine is idle. It never runs on a DEVELOPMENT tree:
there the pre-push gate is the prover, and a background prove would fight it for the CPU (a fleet during a
push starved the render gate, 2026-09-2x). Nothing here decides a verdict; heart2 writes the census and
self_arming reads it, exactly as on his Mac.

#: on them. The 1,024 floor exists for a proof BESIDE a stream (09-29: dwm died at 690 MB free with Boosteroid
