"""A PROOF THAT DECLARES NO MATCH COUNT MUST STILL BE ABLE TO TAMPER.

`RED_PROOF` is declared in two shapes. 374 gates use dicts carrying a numeric `matches`; **12 use
4-tuples that carry no count at all** (REG-1045). v3241 taught the comparison to treat an absent
count as UNKNOWN — check `got >= 1` always, compare exactly only when somebody declared a number —
which is right, and which the well-formedness law already did.

**And `_prove_one` passes that same value straight to `str.replace` as its count:**

```python
_tampered = original.replace(find, repl, want)     # want is None
"aa".replace("a", "b", None)
TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```

So all 32 count-less proofs would have raised **at the tampering step** — the fix for "the prover
could not READ them" would have become "the prover crashes while TAMPERING them", one line later.
Found by a cross-family review of v3241, the version that introduced the None.

⚠ ONE FIELD, THREE READERS, and each needed telling separately: `_normalise_proofs` (absent is
legal), the comparison (absent means do not compare), and `str.replace` (absent is not an integer).
Every time this repo has been bitten it was a second reader of a field somebody had just changed
the meaning of. [[unknown-stays-unknown]] [[copy-drift]] [[the-unjoined-end]]

The rule is the same everywhere: nobody declared a number, so tamper EVERY occurrence — which is
precisely what `got` counted and what the `got >= 1` check accepted a moment earlier.
