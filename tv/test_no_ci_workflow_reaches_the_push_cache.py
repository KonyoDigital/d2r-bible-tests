"""#173 (REG-2939) - NO CI WORKFLOW REACHES THE PUSH-TIME PROOF CACHE. Moved out of
test_a_proven_verdict_is_reused_only_on_identical_bytes, verbatim.

heart2's verdict cache is opened only by prove(push=True) on his machines; CI must run every proof (its verdict is the
one of record), so no workflow may run `--push` or name .heart2_cache - except a proof shard (REG-2588), which proves
into its own fresh cache. The rule reads every workflow in .github/workflows: the folder is the denominator, so a new
workflow cannot slip past. That listing is why it lives alone: a law that lists a directory itself cannot have its
proofs saved, and inside the cache law it made all 27 of that law's proofs re-run on every push. Here it is one cheap
case, listed in tv/unkeyable_laws.json on purpose. [[regression-guard]]
