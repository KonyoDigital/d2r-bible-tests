"""REG-2094 - ESCAPE CLOSES THE CARD THE LATCH NAMES, NEVER AN ITEM CARD OPENED AFTER IT.

The #231 code seat on May's 0133be32 and 113be899, re-measured at the v3630 tip: a material or rune card sets
window.__activeMaterial / __activeRune so Escape can close it (closeDrop empties #item-detail). navigateToItem - a grail
chip, a search pick, openDrop's grail branch - painted an ITEM card over it through renderDetail and left the latch set,
so the next Escape wiped the item card he had just opened. MEASURED on the real page as the owner: HEAD left the latch
'Key of Terror' under a Harlequin Crest card and Escape emptied it; this tree clears the latch and the card survives.
The reset lives in renderDetail, the one place an item card is painted, so every caller is covered. The browser half -
Escape driven for real, with a baseline that it still closes a material card - is tests/reg2094_escape_keeps_the_item_card.
