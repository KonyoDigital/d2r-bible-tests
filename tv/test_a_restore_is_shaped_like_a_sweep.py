"""A RESTORE PROPOSAL MUST BE SHAPED LIKE A SWEEP — THIS DOOR HAD NEVER APPLIED ANYTHING.

`ledger_restore.proposal_from()` built `add[half][name] = []` — a DICT keyed by name. The board's
`chronicleApply` in bible.html does `(add.uniques || []).forEach(...)`, and a plain object has no
`forEach`. So every restore that ever reached the board died with
*"(add.uniques || []).forEach is not a function"* and wrote NOTHING.

MEASURED 2026-09-16 on his live board, restoring 85 uniques + 50 sets after an install-id change
wiped his visible ledger: the call REACHED bible.html — the TypeError quotes bible.html's own
v2690 comment back — and every count was unchanged afterwards. With the shape corrected, the same
proposal moved foundLog 363 -> 445, setPieces 83 -> 133, chronFound 280 -> 309.

⚠⚠ WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT FOR 478 VERSIONS. `plan()` is read-only and its counts were always
correct, so the dry run, the plan endpoint and every test of them looked right. The only half that
was wrong was the half that crosses into the board, and nothing on the Python side of that boundary
could see it. Two halves, each correct on its own, joined at neither. [[the-unjoined-end]]

⚠ THE SHAPE IS NOT INVENTED HERE. A real sweep already ships `"wouldAdd": {lg: [{"name": n, ...}]}`
at two call sites in control_app.py, and `proposal_from`'s own docstring promises "the same
vocabulary a sweep uses". It said so and did the other thing — so this pins the PROMISE, not a
number. [[regression-guard]] [[source-reading-guard]]
