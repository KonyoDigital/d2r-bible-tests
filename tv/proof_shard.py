"""REG-2585 / REG-2586 — ONE PROVE, MANY MACHINES: a proof-level shard plan, and the import that brings shards home.

⚠ WHY. A full `heart2 --prove` is ~3.5 h on his Mac (V1: 4,353 proofs). Per-proof keys cannot shrink the count (Phase 0
and 0b, /workspace notes: no design gets under ~1,900 re-proves), so the lever left is WALL TIME: the same proofs, on
many CI runners at once, banked into the verdict cache, then brought home.

THE PLAN (REG-2585). `heart2 --prove [names] --push --proof-shard K/N` proves only shard K's proofs. Every shard
computes the SAME plan from the same bytes: each gate's proofs are cut into contiguous chunks no costlier than about a
quarter of a shard's fair share (gate_costs.json prices one run of the gate; a chunk pays one clean run plus one run
per proof), and the chunks go, costliest first, to the least-loaded shard (ties to the lowest K). So a 41-proof
browser gate no longer sits on one runner for over an hour, and every (gate, proof) lands in EXACTLY ONE shard - a
proof in none is never proven, a proof in two is paid twice. The plan's digest names gate, index, the proof entry
itself and the shard, so shards cut from different names, bytes or N cannot pass as one set.

THE IMPORT (REG-2586). `heart2 --import-shards FILE...` merges the shards' banked PROVENs into this machine's verdict
cache, through the store's one locked writer, ALL OR NOTHING:
  · every shard 1..N is present exactly once, each FINISHED, all with one N and one plan digest;
  · every shard ran on THIS checkout's HEAD sha, from a clean tree (no tracked file differing from HEAD);
  · an entry is taken only if it is what peek() would serve: a dated, static, fact-free PROVEN - an ELSEWHERE, a
    BLIND, an UNPROVABLE, an undated or a traced entry is never banked;
  · an entry must belong to the shard that carries it (its gate and proof index are in that shard's plan) - a stray
    entry means the file is not what the shard wrote, and the import refuses;
  · the entry's `tree` is KEPT as the runner wrote it, never rewritten: #242's guard (_wave_gate) then still owes this
    tree one clean run of each gate before its imported proofs are reused here;
  · a key this machine already serves is kept as it is (its tree, its age) - an import never displaces a local proof.
Refused means nothing is written. [[unknown-stays-unknown]] [[inherited-claim-is-not-evidence]]
