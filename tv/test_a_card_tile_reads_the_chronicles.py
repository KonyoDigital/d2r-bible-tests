"""THE REEL CARD'S LAST TWO TILES MUST READ THE CHRONICLES, AND AN ABSENT ROSTER IS NOT A ZERO.

Konyo, 2026-09-13: *"and the photo data anylasis within the video here where its says grail.. i want
it reading the chronicles.. what does cover even mean? i think it can also be rem[ov]ed visually so i
dont see it and see the chronicles sets or uniques instead of it. so 4 also"*

He was right on both counts, and the numbers say why. MEASURED over the **425 cards the shelf
actually renders** — not all 2,893 journal rows, because the shelf hides empty runs and that wrong
denominator would have overstated every figure here ([[zero-needs-a-denominator]]):

    COVER   had a value on  16 of 425 cards — and TWELVE of those sixteen read 0%.
            A real figure appeared on FOUR cards in four hundred and twenty-five. Furniture.
    GRAILS  counted `tier === 'grail'` and found 16, because `tier` is NEVER SET on 194 of the
            218 finds (89%). It was not measuring rarity. It was measuring whether one optional
            field happened to be filled in.

Every find carries a NAME, and the chronicle rosters know what a name IS — 398 uniques, 135 set
pieces. Folding the same 218 names: **57 uniques + 26 sets = 83 classified, against the old tile's
16**, and a figure on 25 cards where the old one managed 10. The 135 that match nothing are base
items and runewords ("Amulet", "Battle Staff", "Bramble") and are CORRECTLY not chronicle rows.
[[the-unjoined-end]]

⚠ IT FOLDS WITH THE LANE'S OWN RESOLVER. `chronicle_resolve.canonical` already handles apostrophe
forms, the "(amulet)" suffix, and REFUSES ambiguous near-twins like "Bone Break"/"Latent Bone
Break". Measured before trusting it: exact-fold and canonical() return the identical 57/26/135 on
his real data, zero drift. A second comparison written at the call site is how one near-twin gets
folded two different ways in two places. [[copy-drift]]

⚠⚠ AND `—` AND `?` ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS. `—` is a measured none; `?` is the roster failing to
load. `load_roster` RAISES rather than returning `{}` in its own words because "an empty roster
would silently classify every name as debris" — which here would print a confident **0 uniques on
every card in the shelf**. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

        Found by the post-ship review, not by this file. v3090 guarded the ROSTER branch —
