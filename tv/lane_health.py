"""LANE HEALTH — every extraction lane says when it last did work, and a stalled one says so ITSELF.

Konyo, 2026-08-29, after asking why nothing had been extracted "for days" and having to be told:
"eagle eye watchdog.. corroborator all need to be coded accordingly so its all working and
communicating.. we need this ready for traffic and optimized and self looped like the rest of the
system. intelligent architecture code"

⚠ THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR, MEASURED THE DAY IT WAS WRITTEN:

    chronicle_swept.json    36 sessions   newest seal   49.2 h ago    working
    vault_swept.json         8 sessions   newest seal  136.7 h ago    STALLED 5.7 DAYS
    sessions the chronicle lane swept that the vault lane never sealed: 36

frame_authority reads the VAULT seal, so those 36 sessions' frames were all held as "not sealed"
and nothing was prunable. Nothing on the console said the vault lane had stopped. The auto-sweep
watchdog (_chron_autoread_watch, v2139) speaks only when its MESSAGE CHANGES — the right fix for a
loop that logged 1,700 lines a day, and the exact wrong shape for a lane that has been answering
the same thing for five days. Silence had become the report. [[feedback-silence-is-not-evidence]]

THREE THINGS, and they are deliberately separate:
  · FRESHNESS  — when did this lane last produce work, and is that longer than it should be
  · REACH      — how much of the corpus has it covered
  · DIVERGENCE — where two lanes disagree about the SAME session, which is the defect above and
                 which neither lane can see on its own. This is the corroborator's job.

⚠ IT DECIDES NOTHING AND WRITES NOTHING. Same shape as prune_shadow and slot_identity: it reads,
it explains, and an unreadable store makes it answer UNKNOWN rather than healthy. A watchdog that
cannot tell "quiet" from "dead" is the thing being replaced here.
