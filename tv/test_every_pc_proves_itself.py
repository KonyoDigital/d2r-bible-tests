"""#50 — EVERY PC PROVES ITS OWN INSTRUMENTS, IN THE BACKGROUND (REG-1447).

His ruling 2026-09-29: the ALT and Dean's PC must prove their own gates - a Mac proof does not speak for
Windows (measured: different gate fingerprints at one commit; the river-outlet law BLIND on the ALT and
red on the Mac). Until today only his Mac's pre-push gate ever wrote a heart census, so on every other PC
`self_arming.may()` said "the heart has never run here" and every lock stayed shut - 76 ALT reels at
EMPTY never routed.

DRIVEN: `self_prove.decide` across every state; `self_prove.tick` end to end with a recording spawn, a
temp memory file and stubbed census/tree/load - never a real prover; `tree_state` on a real temporary
git repo (clean + at upstream -> installed; a local edit or an unpushed commit -> dev); `pid_alive` on
this process and on a dead pid; the rescue loop asks. RED_PROOF below.

REG-1511 (review of v3524) - TheStandAsideIsSafe drives the stand-aside against a REUSED pid (alive, other birth),
a prover that survives its kill, the start/kill flap, a proof already finishing, Boosteroid idling in the tray (the
real Toolhelp walk and memory read over a stubbed kernel32), the prover's own law in a Mac `ps` listing, and free
memory on a Mac without psutil. Never a real kill: every kill is a recorder, every Windows edge a stub.
