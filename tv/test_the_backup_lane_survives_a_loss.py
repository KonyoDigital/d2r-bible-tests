"""THE BACKUP LANE MUST SURVIVE A LOSS — a drop is SEEN, the restore reads the backup BEFORE it,
the prune keeps that backup, and the doctor says so until the store is back.

Konyo: *"ledgers and backups and all correctly wired and joined and obivusly read blueprints to see
whats already archirtured"* / *"the heart too dont forget"*.

MEASURED 2026-09-27 on his real backup dir (shape only — this law never reads or writes it):

    ledger_2026-09-27_024127.json   setPieces 134   owned 223
    ledger_2026-09-27_033127.json   setPieces   0   owned   0      <- a vault reset
    every backup after              setPieces   0   owned   0

Three things that already existed each missed it, and every one was built correctly:
  · `ledger_restore.plan()` took hits[0] — the NEWEST backup — so the restore door would have put
    back NOTHING (the newest held 0 pieces);
  · the prune's episode guard reads `d2r_storeEmptied`, which the board writes only when the FOUND
    ledger comes up empty at load, so nothing opened an episode and the 02:41 file was protected
    only by luck (the prune had not reached it yet);
  · the doctor's `ledger entries` row diffs only the TWO NEWEST snapshots, so one snapshot after
    the drop it went clean with the pieces still gone.

WHAT THIS PINS, EACH DRIVEN (the shipped code runs; nothing here greps source):
  1. `ledger_restore.drops_between` — ONE definition of a drop (to 0, or by >= max(10, 25%)), and an
     UNKNOWN count is never a drop;
  2. the plan reads a dropped store from the last backup BEFORE the drop, says so per store, and
     goes back to the newest once the store recovers; the doors for the other stores read the SAME
     per-store source;
  3. a file HE NAMES wins; a traversal, a symlink out, an unrouted or another profile's file is
     refused — and the HTTP routes carry {"file": name} through;
  4. one REAL iteration of `_ledger_backup_loop` (pinned clock, stubbed board, real writer) opens a
     durable episode and the prune keeps its before-file past every age rule;
  5. the episode CLOSES when the store is back to >= where it fell from; a first look REPLAYS a drop
     that happened before the watcher existed; an unreadable record is set aside, never written
     over, and while it is unreadable the prune deletes NOTHING;
  6. THE HEART — the doctor row `ledger drop` names store/from/to/when and the door, is UNKNOWN when
     it cannot see, and watches the watcher (a newest backup it never judged is MISSING).

⚠ FIXTURES ONLY. TV_HIST points the record at a temp world before control_app is imported; the
backup dir is a temp dir; the board is a stub; the clock is pinned. [[feedback-fixtures-never-touch-live-data]]
