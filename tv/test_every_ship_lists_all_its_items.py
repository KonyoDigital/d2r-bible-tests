"""v3848 (Elad 10:20) - EVERY VERSION'S HISTORY LISTS ALL ITS ITEMS.

His VERSION HISTORY showed 3 lines for v3847, which shipped ~15 things. From v3846 on, a version's CHANGELOG
entry has at least one line per feature/fix commit of that version: a commit whose subject starts "vNNNN: "
(CI/gate-fix commits are "vNNNN CI ..." and do not count; the ship-title commit "vNNNN: Two Words" does not count).
A version with no such commit in reach of the clone (shallow CI) is reported, never silently passed as checked.
