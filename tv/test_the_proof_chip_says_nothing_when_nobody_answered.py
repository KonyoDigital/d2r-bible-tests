"""THE VAULT'S PROOF CHIP MUST BE ABSENT WHEN NOBODY ANSWERED — NOT ZERO.

Konyo, looking at the Vault: *"stlll the vault"*. His lockers show 165 items; the vault ledger
proves 14. #105 established *only ledger+proof enters* and the bar could never reach this surface,
because the lockers are built from `owned` + `d2r_muleAssign` and **bible.html has no proof store
at all** — the only `d2r_vault*` keys are Backfill, BackfillUndo, EvidenceRestore, Removed and
RerouteDone. The witnesses live in the console's `vault_accum.json`. [[the-unjoined-end]]

⚠⚠ IT MARKS AND DOES NOT FILTER, and the names are why. The 14 that clear the bar are
Full Rejuvenation Potion, Super Mana Potion, Horadric Cube, Radiance (103 witnesses), six Grand
Charms, Bone Break, Magefist, Heart of the Oak, Renewed Black Cleft — every one a consumable, a
charm or the Cube, and not one a unique or set piece his vault holds. They cleared the bar because
an OCR sweep sees a rejuv potion in every stash frame and a Shako in one. Hiding the unproven
would empty his vault of every real keeper and leave the potions.

⚠⚠ AND THIS PAGE IS ALSO THE PUBLIC SITE, where no console exists and the ask always fails. A
chip reading "⚖ 0" there would be a claim about his vault manufactured from a failed fetch, shown
to strangers. Absent is the only honest rendering of "nobody could look".
