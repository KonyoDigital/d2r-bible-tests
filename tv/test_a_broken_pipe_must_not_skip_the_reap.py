"""v3421 — A FAILURE CLOSING stdin MUST NOT SKIP THE REAP.

The shutdown of the ocr worker was three statements sharing one `try`:

    try:
        wp.stdin.close(); wp.terminate()
        threading.Thread(target=wp.wait, daemon=True, name="tvd-ocr-reap").start()
    except Exception:
        pass

`wp.stdin.close()` raises BrokenPipeError when the worker has **already exited on its own** — and
that is precisely the case that leaves a zombie. One raise and `terminate()` never ran, the reaper
thread never started, and the bare `except` said nothing. **The guard was skipped in exactly the
scenario it was written for, and looked healthy in every other.**

⚠ THE FIX IT REPLACED WAS ITSELF A FIX. The comment at that site already read *"Measured
2026-09-01: 12 defunct children, oldest 16.5h"* — the reap had been added three weeks earlier and
leaked anyway, because of the shared `try` one line above it.

MEASURED 2026-09-23: 14 defunct children of his console. A 95-minute catcher sampling every second
logged 81 children; exactly one later became defunct, and it had been caught ALIVE first —
`tv/bin/ocr_mac --worker`, pid 88160, alive 23:36:21, `<defunct>` 70 minutes later. **A zombie
carries no argv**, so nothing but catching it alive could have named the site; four rounds of
reading the file could not choose between three Popen sites.

⚠ THIS GATE DRIVES THE SHIPPED ROUTINE. `close_ocr_worker` was extracted so the failure can be
handed to it directly — a source check would only prove the text is arranged a certain way, not
that a broken pipe still gets reaped. [[copy-drift]] §7 — one routine, one home, and the other
sites call it.

        v3421 required only that a `TimeoutExpired` handler contain calls named `kill` and
        `communicate`/`wait`. `kill(); communicate(timeout=10)` satisfies that and DOES NOT REAP:
        on CPython 3.9 `communicate` runs its select loop first and only reaches `self.wait(...)`
        afterwards, so a second timeout escapes before any wait happens. MEASURED, not argued — see
        the behavioural case below. A law shaped like the fix it was written beside will accept
        every wrong implementation that happens to use the same words.
