"""v2729 — A CENTRED LABEL WITH NO WIDTH BOUND IS A COLLISION WAITING FOR MORE DATA.

The heart's lock fan draws each lock's lines with `text-anchor="middle"` at a point chosen by its
INDEX in a sorted list (control_ui.html: `reach = [0.78, 1.06, 1.34][j % 3]`). Position comes from
the index; WIDTH comes from the content; nothing ever compares them. So the fan is correct only for
the content it happened to hold when someone last looked at it.

PROVEN BY CAUSING IT, 2026-09-06: banking evidence into `reel.route` and `frame.release` changed
nothing but the NUMBERS inside two labels, and `overlap_ratchet` went 2 -> 4 at 1120, 1440 and 901,
and 0 -> 2 at 375. No code was touched. That is why this file pins WIDTH BOUNDS rather than a
layout: the layout cannot be made safe while any label can grow without limit.

WHAT THIS PINS, AND WHY EACH IS A LAW AND NOT A STRING
------------------------------------------------------
1. THE BLIND-CLAIMS LABEL MUST NOT INTERPOLATE AN UNBOUNDED LIST. It read
       arith = k + '/' + n + ' on the claims that RAN · ' + blind.length + ' never ran (' +
               _blind.join(', ') + ')'
   — every blind claim's NAME, joined, into a centred label. Measured at 1440: 313px, against lock
   names of 89-104px. THREE TIMES WIDER than the thing it belongs to, and growing with every claim
   added. Bounding it is what took 375 back to zero.
   ⚠ THE COUNT IS THE FACT AND MUST SURVIVE. "3 never ran" is the claim a reader acts on; the names
   are detail. A bound that dropped the number instead of the names would be the wrong half.

2. NO LABEL PRINTS ITS OWN SCORE TWICE. The second arithmetic line appended ' → ' + wilsonByAttack,
   and the first line already prints the deciding score — which IS wilsonByAttack for every lock in
   this fan (`deciding` is `wilsonByAttack`). ~40px of width for a number already on screen, one
   line up, where it is compared against its bar and therefore means something.

⚠⚠ WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it does not pin an overlap COUNT. `overlap_ratchet`
owns that, it is baselined, and it can only run where the live console is. This file runs anywhere
and grades the one thing that is checkable from source — that no label can grow without limit.
A gate that cannot run on CI is not a substitute for one that can. [[regression-guard]]
