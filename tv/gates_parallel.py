"""v3842 GATE-TRIM A - `run_gates.py --full --parallel auto`: the light gates as 3 shards at once, the heavy ones alone.

MEASURED on v3841's --full (09:05-10:17 IDT, Oct 29): 1,304 gates ran fully serial, 72 min wall for a 69-min serial sum.
The ~1,280 gates under 30 s are mostly process start and import; the 24 at or over 30 s are 43% of the time and include
the ones that slow down badly under load (test_control: 19.5 s idle, 565.9 s loaded - run_gates.py's REG note).

So: the light set is cut into 3 cost-balanced slices (the same LPT greedy as --shard, on gate_costs.json) and each slice
runs as its own `run_gates.py --full --only ...` in its own detached worktree at THIS commit - one run per tree, as
_claim_the_tree requires (REG-162: two runs in one tree share ports, reel dirs and the journal). Only after all three
finish do the heavy gates run, serially, in this tree, with nothing beside them. Every gate still runs; every verdict is
still its own run's; a red in any slice is a red gate set. Nothing is carried that --full would not have run.

Falls back to the plain serial --full, and says why, when: free memory is under FLOOR_GB, the tree has uncommitted
tracked changes (a worktree at HEAD would not be these bytes), or a worktree cannot be made.
