"""ONE way to address a frame, because three ad-hoc ones invented three crises in a day.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A frame in this tree is referred to in THREE shapes, and every measurement that
knew only one of them produced an alarming number that was false:

    <n>_<ms>                        e.g. 21_1787522052389      (journal frameId, no extension)
    f_<ms>.jpg                      e.g. f_1788202324097.jpg   (top-level capture)
    <reel>/f_<ms>.jpg               e.g. reel_s_1784984019250_95276/f_1784984201778

Measured 2026-09-01, each of these was reported to Konyo before being checked, and each was wrong:

    "45% of cited frames are gone from disk"       -> resolver tested only `k == fid`
    "48% carry a reel id where a frame belongs"    -> they are PATHS, which carry more, not less
    "100% of named claims are unprovable"          -> endswith("/"+stem) needs a directory, and
                                                      top-level files have none

With a correct two-way index - full relative path AND bare stem - **every cited frame resolves.
0 gone, in both the named and unnamed sets.** There are no orphaned frameIds and no unprovable
claims. The corpus was never the problem; the questions were.

⚠ THE POINT IS NOT THE DATA, IT IS THE ARITHMETIC. A resolver that silently fails to match
answers "missing", and "missing" is indistinguishable from "deleted" to every caller. That is how
a healthy 9.6 GB archive read as 45% rotted three times in one evening.
