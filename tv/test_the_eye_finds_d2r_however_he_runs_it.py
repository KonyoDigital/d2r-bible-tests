"""#232 — THE EYE FINDS DIABLO II: RESURRECTED HOWEVER HE RUNS IT, AND ONLY THE GAME.

HIS ORDER, 2026-09-24: "needs to target diablo ii resurrected in macbook like it is crossover or
nvideaplay chrome or boosteroid so windows also regularly for those options + the usual route on
windows locally. and linux cant open those they lock automatically".

MEASURED before this: on the Mac every browser was blocked wholesale, so a GeForce NOW session in a
Chrome tab could never pin; on Windows capture_win.ps1 only enumerated D2R-process windows, so a
streamed session fell through to FULL SCREEN and filmed the desktop. And a store-style title,
"Diablo® II: Resurrected™", never matched "diablo ii" because of the ®.

DRIVEN on the pure picker (game_route + score_d2r_window_candidate) and, for Windows, on the
C# source the script compiles (its routes are asserted by text here and COMPILED on the Windows box
over SSH; a Mac cannot run Add-Type). ⚠ The real cloud window titles are UNMEASURED: the cases below
use the shape the services are expected to show, and a service window whose title does NOT name the
game is a near-miss the picker reports rather than pins. RED_PROOF below.
