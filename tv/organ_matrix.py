"""A3 — WHICH SURFACES HAVE WHICH ORGANS, MEASURED, WITH THE HOLES LEFT AS HOLES.

His ask, over a table that was mostly empty: *"fix those gaps and anywhere else.. make it unified
and logical and coded properly with watchdogged and eagle eyed and doctor and corraborotror"* —
`surfaces registry` empty across every column, `stash_eye grid` empty, `enlarge` empty, `OCR worker`
present in exactly one. **Every surface gets the same four organs, or it is honestly marked as not
having them.**

⚠⚠ THIS FILE DOES NOT FILL THE TABLE IN. It measures it. A matrix that reports coverage it cannot
demonstrate is worse than the empty one he was shown, because the empty one at least told the
truth. Every cell here is one of:

    COVERED    the organ's own output NAMES this surface — checked, not assumed
    ABSENT     the organ runs and does not name it
    UNKNOWN    the organ could not be asked at all (no report, would not import, raised)

⚠ UNKNOWN IS NOT ABSENT. Two of the four organs have no callable report on this tree —
console_doctor exposes none and there is no `eagle` module — so their columns are UNKNOWN
everywhere rather than empty, and the difference is the whole point. An organ nobody can ask has
not been shown to miss anything; it has not been shown to do anything either.

    answer cannot distinguish "watches nothing" from "had nothing to say just now" (eagle_state()
    returns no rows when the console is not running), so it is UNKNOWN rather than a verdict.

    The rule is deliberately not a threshold: ONE surface resolving is enough to make the
