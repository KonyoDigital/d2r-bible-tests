"""v2760 — HIS OWN FLEET ROW CAME BACK FROM CLOUDFLARE TO TELL HIM WHAT WAS ON HIS OWN DISK.

Konyo, seconds after ticking a set piece: *"i just changed my sets from a 123/135 to 124/135 but
how come THE FLEET is delayed? maybe it still has not fetched the data? should it not be SHARING A
CSS so its rendered is always the same?"*

MEASURED at that moment, on his live machine:

    tv/board_tally.json      sets {have:124, total:135}    written 6 SECONDS ago
    THE FLEET card           SETS 123 / 135                "as of 1m ago"
    Forge · Sets             124 / 135 pieces · 91%

The data was never late. The RENDER was. His own row arrives the way a cousin's does — published
to the server by the beacon, read back through `fleet_presence`, which is 60s cached — so his own
number went out to the network and came home to be shown to him, while the true figure sat in a
file on the same disk. Re-measured 2.5 minutes later: the row said 124. A transient, and a
structural one: the lag is a publish cadence plus a 60s cache, every single time he ticks.

⚠⚠ AND THE ANSWER TO HIS ACTUAL QUESTION IS NO. Sharing a stylesheet would make the two surfaces
LOOK identical while still printing 123 and 124 — the disagreement would survive in matching
fonts, which is worse, because two surfaces that look like one source and disagree are harder to
disbelieve than two that look different. What they have to share is the SOURCE.

=== THE TWO DIRECTIONS THAT MAKE THIS SAFE ===
HIS row is local because it CAN be. A PEER's row must stay on the beacon, because a peer's numbers
are knowable no other way — overlaying local figures onto Dean's row would publish Konyo's board as
Dean's, the same class of defect as rendering one machine's roster as another's denominator.
