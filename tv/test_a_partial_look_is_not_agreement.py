"""v3349 (#104) — A LOOK THAT NEVER REACHED THE CHANGE IS NOT AN OPINION ABOUT IT.

MEASURED ON v3347, live, the day it shipped:

    payload                8,967 of 92,115 diff chars  (the rest cut)
    changed files omitted  10, INCLUDING tv/self_arming.py — the file the version exists to change
    the eye answered       "REACH: 2/2 hunks … all other listed files UNKNOWN.
                            No concrete defect is present in the bytes shown."
    the row stored         verdict=clean

`clean` means the eye looked and found nothing. That eye said, in its own first line, that it
could not look. The assurance was never earned.

=== THE INTENT WAS ALREADY RIGHT; THE STORE WAS WRONG ===
`payload_for()` has computed the omitted list since v3341 and used it to WARN THE EYE inside the
prompt. Its own comment says *"the ROW must carry it too, or a later reader sees a clean verdict
with no way to know its reach"* — and the row did carry it, as a **400-char-capped prose suffix on
`asked`**. A one-to-many fact flattened into another field and truncated, at the one moment keeping
it was free. [[one-to-one-store-for-a-one-to-many-fact]] — the fourth instance of that shape.

So this version does not compute anything new. It carries the LIST to the row and gives it a
reader. [[the-unjoined-end]]

=== `reached` IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION, AND I GOT THIS WRONG FIRST ===
I claimed `reached` was already lying on the v3347 row. It was not. `reached` means THE SEAT
ANSWERED — "an unreachable eye is an EMPTY SEAT, never agreement". A reachable eye handed two
hunks of a twelve-file change is `reached=True` and blind, which is exactly that row. Two
questions, two fields; the second one simply did not exist.

=== WHY THIS DOES NOT DECIDE THE VERDICT, YET ===
The obvious next step is to downgrade such a look from `clean` to `cannot-tell`. That is
deliberately NOT in this version. #97 measured that **22 of 36 versions (61%)** had a code file
never reach the eye, so a blanket rule would move a large population, and the radius cannot be
sized from the ledger because the data was never stored — which is the whole defect. #101 already
proved once this session that a verdict rule designed without measurement gets refuted by the
ledger (172 of 637). **Persist first, judge once there are rows to judge against.**
[[regression-guard]] §5a

⚠ PARTIAL LOOKS ARE NAMED, NEVER DISCARDED. What the eye said about the bytes it DID see is real
evidence, and dropping it would be its own lie. What must never happen is two partial looks
reading as AGREEMENT about a change neither of them saw.
