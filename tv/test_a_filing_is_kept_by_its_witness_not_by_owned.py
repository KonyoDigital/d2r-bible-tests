"""#246 L12 — A FILING IS KEPT BY ITS WITNESS, NOT BY `owned`.

The render prune in renderVault used to keep a mule filing for exactly as long as its name sat in the owned pool
— and d2r_owned means ticked or found-ever. So `owned` was the only thing a filing answered to: a found-ever name
kept a false filing alive, and a WITNESSED filing whose name left `owned` (a grail un-tick deletes it) was thrown
away with nothing but a found-ever list having spoken.

WHAT THIS LAW HOLDS, driven on the SHIPPED prune statement (cut from bible.html between its own markers, run in
node, never re-typed):
  · a WITNESSED filing (a d2r_vaultProv row) stands when its name is no longer in the pool;
  · an UNWITNESSED filing whose name left the pool goes, as before;
  · an unwitnessed filing still in the pool is NOT deleted here — the fresh vault is his ruling, backed up first —
    and is left for the tile's NO WITNESS tag and the doctor's 'vault provenance' row to call out;
  · a home that is not a mule goes whatever it carries, and __keep stays.
RED_PROOF below.
