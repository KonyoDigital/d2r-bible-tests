"""THE CARDS COME FIRST, AND ACTIVITY LEADS THE ANALYTIC BAND BEHIND THEM.

⚠⚠ TWO OF HIS ASKS PULL IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND ONE OF THEM IS A MEASURED SCAR.

Konyo, 2026-09-14, on the runs-per-day chart: *"for the ACTIVITY section i like i just want it
stretched from top to bottom more so its more representing chart and uptop organized with the other
data/anlytics TOP of the SHELF section move and stretched a little bit so its more seen the
difference bettween 1 run and 10 runs"*.

Read literally that is "put it above the list", and v2985 already MEASURED what that costs on his
real screen at 1120x660: the overlay is trapped inside `.stage` — a grid row worth ~449px of a 660px
window — and **549px of furniture above the first card put every reel off-screen**. The panel named
"your reels" was showing none of them, and Grok Bot photographed it three times and called it blank.
"BLANK" and "below-fold" were one defect.

So this law holds both halves at once and refuses to let either quietly win:

    THE LIST comes before every analytic block                  <- v2985's scar, never re-broken
    ACTIVITY leads the analytic band, not trails it             <- his 2026-09-14 ask

⚠ IT READS THE ASSEMBLY, NOT A CLASS NAME. The shelf is built as one flat string concatenation, so
the order of those pieces IS the DOM order. This law extracts that statement between two anchors,
asserts each marker occurs exactly ONCE inside it — a marker that matched twice would make any
index comparison meaningless — and PRINTS the order it found. [[source-reading-guard]]
[[zero-needs-a-denominator]]

=== ⛔ THE ORDERING CLAUSES OF THIS LAW ARE RETIRED — HIS RULING SUPERSEDED THEM (v3359) ===
v3289 records his words twice over: *"the row where it says BEST RUN MOST READS TOP READS BEST
COVERAGE AND STREAK i want at the tippy top of the SHELF TAB above the sessions reels"*, then
*"and the activity i want uptop under the BEST RUNS row"*. That request reopens v2985's scar ON
PURPOSE and pays for it with `window._shOpenOnAReel`, a scroll guard that runs AFTER `_shTimeline()`
so the shelf still OPENS ON A REEL. v3289 measured both states on his live console at 1120x660:

    order alone      scrollTop 0     firstCardTop 815   firstCardVisible FALSE
    order + guard    scrollTop 476   firstCardTop 235   firstCardVisible TRUE

⚠⚠ I BROKE THE GUARD AND THEN READ THE RESULT AS THE DEFECT. In v3358 I probed his console, saw
the first card at 211 with scrollTop 497 — the guard working — then RESET scrollTop to 0 "to see
what he sees when it opens", measured 708 in a 660 viewport, and reordered the shelf to put the
list first. That overturned a ruling he gave twice, on a measurement I created by disabling the
mechanism that exists to make his ruling safe. v3289's own law went red and named it.
[[stale-reading]] [[feedback-suspect-the-instrument]]

THE AUTHORITY ON SHELF ORDER IS `test_the_shelf_opens_on_a_reel`. What survives here is everything
that is NOT about order: nothing dropped, the controls preceding the list, the badge facts.
