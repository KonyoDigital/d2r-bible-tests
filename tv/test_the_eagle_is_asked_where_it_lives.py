"""THE EAGLE'S COLUMN COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ANYTHING BUT EMPTY, AND THE TABLE SAID SO ABOUT THE
EAGLE RATHER THAN ABOUT ITSELF.

`organ_matrix` asks each organ what it names. For the eagle it did `__import__("control_app")` and
called `eagle_state()` — on a FRESHLY IMPORTED module, where `_EAGLE` is still the literal it is
defined as: `{"checked": None, "rows": [], "say": "not measured yet"}`. That dict is only ever
filled by the RUNNING console's background loop, in another process. So the answer was [] every
time, for every tree, no matter how well the eagle worked.

MEASURED 2026-09-12: the live console published 58 eagle rows on /api/status in the same minute the
table printed "eagle answered, and named nothing at all — which cannot tell 'watches nothing' apart
from 'had nothing to say just now'". It was neither. Nobody had asked the process that knows. After
pointing the reader at the console the same organ reports 59 names.

⚠⚠ AND THE FAILURE WAS INVISIBLE BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE A FINDING. An empty answer from an organ
reads as a verdict about the organ; it was a verdict about the reader. That is why this law exists
and why it checks the READER, not the eagle. [[feedback-suspect-the-instrument]]
[[the-unjoined-end]] [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]

⚠ The second half matters as much as the first: when the console is NOT running, this must answer
UNKNOWN with a reason, never an empty set. "The console was down" and "the eagle watches nothing"
are opposite facts and only one of them is a defect. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
