"""v3848 (Dean /api/river 23-38 s under load) - OVERLAPPING RIVER ASKS SHARE ONE WALK.

Every overlapping /api/river started its own reel_router walk on a busy GIL. Now asks that overlap a walk with the
same hide set wait for it and take its answer; an ask after it ends walks again (nothing outlives the walk), an error
reaches every waiter, and the route calls the shared door. No timeout was raised.
