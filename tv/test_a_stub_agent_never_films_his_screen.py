"""#63 — A TV_STUB AGENT NEVER FILMS HIS SCREEN.

MEASURED 2026-09-28 (tv_diablo.py ~7697): under TV_STUB the live loop called the REAL capture_mac(frame)
FIRST and used capture_stub_synth only when that FAILED. On his Mac Screen Recording is granted, so a
stub agent filmed + OCR'd whatever was on his screen, and test_roundtrip_sim passed at 17:12 and failed
at 19:05 on the same commit. His words: "make sure nothing is running on my pc for nothing".

AND THE HALF THE BRIEF DID NOT NAME, MEASURED 2026-09-29 before building: test_roundtrip_sim's agent is
NOT a stub agent. Its console runs with TV_STUB=1, but /api/on spawns with sim=False and _env_clean
POPS TV_STUB — a probe read the running agent's environment: TV_STUB absent. So a guard inside the
agent alone could not have made that verdict independent of his screen. A TV_STUB console now hands
its live agent TV_CAPTURE=off (the door #236 proved never touches a window).

THE LAWS
  · DRIVEN, a real agent process: under TV_STUB, with capture_mac, every Quartz grab and the window
    picker patched to RECORD-AND-RAISE, the agent still settles and reads on synthetic frames, and none
    of them was ever called — not by the live loop, not by the film thread (handed a pinned window), not
    by the farewell look.
  · TV_STUB_REAL_CAPTURE=1 restores the old order: capture_mac is asked first (patched to fail), the
    synthetic frames still flow.
  · the console: a TV_STUB console's live agent gets TV_CAPTURE=off (unless the opt-in); on Windows a
    stub agent's capture half (capture_win.ps1) is never spawned, and its lamp reads OFF, not a death.
  · #63 follow-up (the review of #63): the TCC ask (screen_recording_ok -> CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess),
    the System Settings deep-link and the game gate's window/process walk are screen doors too. A stub
    agent AND a TV_CAPTURE=off agent (the one a stub console hands to /api/on) call none of them - at
    the boot preflight, in the capture-fail branch, or in the game gate. Driven on real agent processes,
    and in-process with the platform handed in so the boot ask is a law off a Mac as well.
