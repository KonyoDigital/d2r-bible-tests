"""★ v3272 — A BAND HE CANNOT GET RID OF IS A TRAP, AND BOTH PLATFORMS HAD ONE.

Grok Bot, from his NATIVE Linux seat, 2026-09-17 18:06 IDT: **"Trap: persistent 🐧 LINUX toast."**

He is right about the shape. `#cousin-ribbon` is `position:fixed; top:0; z-index:2000`, appended
once on every non-Mac machine and removed by NOTHING — five references in bible.html, not one of
them a hide or a remove. It looks like a toast and behaves like furniture.

It is the exact TWIN of what Konyo reported the same day on the other platform: *"that TVdaiblo
banner lol still there uptop only on my macbook"*. Each machine had its own permanent
top-of-screen band, and neither could be put away. The Mac one belongs to pywebview's cocoa code
and its fix crashed his console at v3206 (REG-1081); **this one is ours**.

⚠ IT COLLAPSES, IT DOES NOT VANISH — and that is the whole design. Five CSS rules push
`#v687-build-badge`, `#ladder-ribbon` and `#tvf-console-return` down to clear this ribbon.
Removing the element would leave every one of those reservations holding empty space, and v2061
already measured this family colliding at 375/480/560/640. The collapsed state keeps the SAME
HEIGHT and sheds only width, so no clamp changes and no new collision surface.
[[the-unjoined-end]] [[copy-drift]]

⚠ AND THE BAND STAYS `pointer-events:none`. It is 442px wide at top-centre and v2061 measured it
crossing ⌂CONSOLE below 684px; making the whole band clickable would hand it the power to eat that
click. Only the badge takes pointer events.
