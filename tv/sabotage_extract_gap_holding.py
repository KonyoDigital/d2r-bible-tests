"""PROVE test_extract_gap_holding.py RED. A gate never seen red is measuring nothing.

    python3 tv/sabotage_extract_gap_holding.py

Each sabotage names an anchor, and the anchor is counted TWICE before it is applied:

  · in the source with every comment and docstring BLANKED OUT — so a law can never be
    "satisfied" by prose. This session watched that defect land six times, once where an
    assertion on `.apply(` was met by a comment reading `reel_route_lane.apply()`.
  · in the raw file, so the edit that goes to disk is the one that was counted.

Both counts must be exactly 1. Anything else and the sabotage did not apply, which makes the
law UNPROVEN rather than fine — so this refuses to report a result for it.
