"""#99 — A PC HE PLAYS ON PROVES ITS INSTRUMENTS A SLICE AT A TIME, AND A SLICE NEVER SPEAKS FOR GATES IT DID NOT RUN.

Konyo, 2026-09-30, on his fleet card: "now only grokbot and ALT TEST is both river stuck". Measured: both PCs have no heart
census, so every self-arming lock (the river's routing among them) stays shut. self_prove only ever started a WHOLE
`heart2.py --prove` (~90 min on his Mac, longer there), which writes its census at the very end; he plays on those PCs
most of the day, the proof stood aside every time, and a proof that stands aside writes nothing. His own Mac is current
only because the pre-push gate proves exactly the gates that changed and stamps the census.

Now each gate keeps the digest of the file it was proved against (`gateShas`), `heart2.py --prove NAMES --slice` merges
one slice and stamps the gate fingerprint only when no declaring gate is owed, and self_prove proves the owed gates a
slice at a time in the idle gaps: cheapest first, a stand-aside costing only its slice, a landed slice counted as
progress. Push-time and full runs stamp exactly as before. It reaches every PC through the ordinary update - nothing is
run by hand on the ALT or on Dean's PC.

Everything here runs on fixture gate files in a temp dir; nothing reads or writes this machine's real census.
