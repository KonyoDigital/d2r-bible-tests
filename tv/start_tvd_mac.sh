# new builds. just make sure the other profile locking of the chronicles and everything is
# connected to the profile and pc related to it.. so nothing ever gets deleted or regressed."
#
# Fixing the reel extract in v2139 made this necessary: sweeps actually run now, and POST
# /api/relaunch correctly refuses while one is reading ("relaunching now would throw away a paid
# read"), so his window sat on v2139 while origin was at v2144. The drift watcher (v2072) has
# always been able to catch up on its own; it just refused to act without this flag.
#
# WHAT MAKES IT SAFE TO ARM, all pre-existing and all still in force:
#   · it refuses while a chronicle or vault sweep is reading (nothing_in_flight)
#   · it refuses while _agent_alive() — HE IS FILMING. A restart then orphans that session's
#     frames, because the reel fold runs at seal (v2071).
#   · webview.start(private_mode=False) means the board's storage survives the restart (v928/v2043)
#   · and v2145 remembers WHICH WORLD the board came back as, so a relaunch that returns a
#     different one is reported by the eagle instead of silently stranding his vault — which is
#     exactly the condition he attached to this.
# Set TV_AUTO_RELAUNCH=0 to go back to announce-only.
# ⚠ v2146 — DISARMED AGAIN, DELIBERATELY, ONE VERSION AFTER ARMING IT. He said yes to auto-relaunch
# ON A CONDITION: "just make sure the other profile locking of the chronicles and everything is
# connected to the profile and pc related to it.. so nothing ever gets deleted or regressed." A
# cross-family review of the v2145 guard showed that condition is NOT met, and the gap is not small:
#
#   · THE GUARD CANNOT SEE THE CASE IT WAS WRITTEN FOR. Identity is only {owner, pfx}, and a CLAIMED
#     board publishes pfx:'' — so a brand-new claimed store is byte-identical to the old one and
#     board_identity_drift() answers "ok" over an empty vault. The install id and profile that WOULD
#     tell them apart already sit on d2r_lsrRoute and this reader ignores them.
#   · AUTO-RELAUNCH NEVER ASKS IT. drift_may_relaunch() checks the env flag and nothing_in_flight();
#     it never calls board_identity_drift(), so an already-drifted world does not block the execv.
#   · AND THE FALLBACK PATH RUNS EPHEMERAL STORAGE. If webview.start() takes its TypeError fallback,
#     the board comes back WITHOUT private_mode=False — v2043 exactly — and auto-relaunch would then
#     repeat that every _DRIFT_EVERY_S (300s) instead of once.
#
# Announcing-only is the honest resting state until the guard detects a new claimed world AND
# drift_may_relaunch consults it. Set TV_AUTO_RELAUNCH=1 by hand to override.
# v2153 — ARMED. Konyo, twice: "it can definitely relaunch to other new builds", and then
# "its still not auto relaunching for the newer updates. we said it should relaunch by itself
# based on updates we do. automatically."
#
# It was armed at v2145 and I DISARMED it at v2146, because the world guard it leans on could not
# yet tell two different CLAIMED stores apart — so a relaunch that came back as a new WebKit store
# would have read as the same world and his vault could have been stranded silently. That was the
# right call then. v2147 rebuilt the guard on d2r_lsrRoute's install id, and drift_may_relaunch()
# now REFUSES on drift. The reason for the 0 is gone, so the 0 goes.
#
# What still stops it, every one of them checked before any execv:
#   * the board's world has drifted           -> refuse (v2147)
#   * a chronicle sweep is reading            -> refuse
#   * a vault sweep is reading                -> refuse
#   * a mini is recording                     -> refuse
#   * the agent is alive, i.e. HE IS FILMING  -> refuse (killing it orphans that reel's frames)
# Set TV_AUTO_RELAUNCH=0 by hand to go back to announce-only.

# tv/install-tvd.sh did — while /api/update's own howTo told him "Relaunch TV
# DIABLO to auto-pull". That sentence was false on every machine, and the only
# way to even LEARN you were behind was to click the version in the footer,
# which nobody does. So a second console sat 1,150 versions back and no surface
# ever said so. [[the-unjoined-end]] [[label-outlived-referent]]
#
# ONLY on a clean tree, and only fast-forward: a machine mid-edit keeps its
# work and is told why it is not updating. Never a rebase, never a merge.
# v2120 (#88) — AND THIS ONE HONOURS THE PIN TOO. There are two pull sites in this file; the
# v1418 block 35 lines below tests TV_NO_AUTO_PULL and this one did not, so it ran FIRST and
# pulled on a machine deliberately held back. The Windows launcher has always honoured it.

# stale headless (v1379.1). But it is UNCONDITIONAL, and two launches close together therefore
# race — launch 2 kills launch 1, launch 3 kills launch 2.
#
# MEASURED on his machine, control_app.log 2026-08-23. He closed the window with ✕, and then:
#     01:30:01  auto-pull: fast-forward ok   → native window up
#     01:30:21  auto-pull: fast-forward ok   → window gone (signal-SIGTERM)
#     01:30:51  auto-pull: fast-forward ok   → window gone (signal-SIGTERM)
# Three launches in fifty seconds, each SIGTERMing the one before it, each stopping ON AIR through
# the exit safeguard. If he had been recording, that is a session killed by a race with itself.
#
# ⚠ AND IT WAS MISREAD ONCE ALREADY. Those three `auto-pull` lines look like a poller reacting to a
# git push; auto-pull runs ONCE PER LAUNCH, right above. Reading them as a timeline of cause pinned
# the blame on a push nine minutes earlier. The lines are a symptom of relaunching, not a cause.
#

# launch is still coming up — stand down rather than take the port from it. An incumbent that is
# genuinely old is stale and still gets replaced, exactly as before.
