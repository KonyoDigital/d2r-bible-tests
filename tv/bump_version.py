"""v1489 — stamp a new version across the four surfaces that carry one.

Usage: python bump_version.py v<N> <short name> <note...>   (the leading 'v' is required)

The version lives in four places: the board's `D2R_BUILD`, `control_app.py`'s `/api/status`,
`tv_diablo.py`'s `VERSION`, and `tv/WINDOWS_SHIP.json`. Bumping them by hand is four chances to
miss one, and a half-bumped tree is not cosmetic — `test_button_matrix` compares the LIVE app's
version to the ship manifest, so a missed stamp surfaces as "the running app is a different build
than the tree you are testing" and sends the next person hunting a phantom.

The board note is a SINGLE-QUOTED JS literal. Writing one by hand during v1478 put an apostrophe in
"someone else's chronicle", which terminated the string early and threw a SyntaxError that blanks
the entire 37k-line page. The syntax gate caught it — but the right place to stop that class is
before it is written, so this refuses an apostrophe outright rather than relying on the gate to
notice afterwards.

Each stamp is verified after writing: a silent no-op replace would leave the tree half-bumped,
which is the exact failure this tool exists to prevent.

    ⚠ THIS IS PER-FILE, NOT ACROSS THE FOUR. A crash between two stamps still leaves the set
    disagreeing; that is a different defect and this does not fix it. Saying otherwise would be
    the overclaim this repo keeps carving. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

    ⚠⚠ v2795 — THIS SILENTLY DISABLED THE ENTIRE PRE-PUSH GATE, AND THE PUSH SAID SO IN A HINT
    NOBODY WOULD HAVE READ TWICE. `os.replace` moves the TEMP FILE's inode into place, and the temp
    file is created with the default 0644 — so every executable this function touched came out
    NON-EXECUTABLE. Measured 2026-09-08: `hooks/pre-push` was 100755 at v2793 and 100644 at v2794,
    and git printed

        hint: The 'hooks/pre-push' hook was ignored because it's not set as executable.

    then pushed straight to origin with NO gates at all — no test_control, no render, no smoke, no
    second eye. The atomicity fix and the mode loss are the same line: preserving the CONTENT while
    dropping the PERMISSION is not preserving the file. [[the-unjoined-end]]

    ⚠⚠ v2797 — AND THE v2795 FIX LEFT A WINDOW, FOUND BY A COLD CROSS-FAMILY REVIEW OF THE
    SHIPPED BYTES. v2795 restored the mode by chmod'ing AFTER os.replace. Between those two calls
    the new content is already live under the TEMP FILE's mode, which is born under umask.
    MEASURED, stopping the sequence mid-way:

        target before         0o755
        the temp file's mode  0o644   <- born under umask
        AFTER os.replace      0o644   <- the window
        after os.chmod        0o755

    For `hooks/pre-push` that window IS THE ORIGINAL DEFECT IN MINIATURE: a push starting inside it
    sees a non-executable hook and skips every gate. Not hypothetical here — pushes run in the
    background while other work continues. Reproduced before being believed.

    ⇒ THE MODE GOES ON THE TEMP FILE, BEFORE THE REPLACE, so the final inode appears with its
    content and its permissions in ONE atomic step. The post-replace chmod survives only as a
    fallback for the case where that pre-chmod itself failed.

    ⚠ AND THE TEMP NAME IS UNIQUE NOW. `path + ".tmp"` is deterministic, so two writers on one path
    silently truncate each other's temp file — bump_version writes four stamps and this session
    routinely runs things concurrently. mkstemp in the SAME directory keeps the rename atomic; a
    cross-filesystem rename is not.

    ⚠ NOT CLAIMED: durability. The same review noted there is no fsync of the file or its parent
    directory, so a crash after the replace can leave the entry pointing at unflushed data. That is
    TRUE and is not fixed here — this function's contract is "no torn read", not "survives power
    loss". Saying so beats implying otherwise. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

    A file that did not exist has no mode to copy and correctly keeps the default.
