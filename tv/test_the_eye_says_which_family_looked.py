"""v2766 — A DARK EYE AND AN ABSENT ONE LOOKED IDENTICAL ON THE FLEET.

MEASURED before the change, off the live beacon:

    Konyo  eye={"live": false, "ageMs": 0}
    Dean   eye={"live": false, "ageMs": 63824123}

and the card rendered the glyph ONLY when `live` was true, so three different machines drew the
same nothing:

    · no second model family is INSTALLED there   (Dean — correct and expected)
    · one is installed and IDLE                   (Konyo, lane toggled off)
    · one is installed, on, and FAILING

Absence, rest and failure are not the same fact. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]

=== ⚠ WHAT THIS IS *NOT* ===
The task that produced this file was first written as "make the eye provider-neutral", and that was
WRONG — it already is, and the correction is kept here because writing it before measuring is the
error worth remembering:

    chronicle_hunt.py   lane = (page or {}).get("lane") or "claude"   <- Claude IS the default
    chronicle_hunt.py   ZERO grok references anywhere in the reader
    control_app.py      "GROK EYES (G5) — REMOVABLE. OFF by default." + a removal checklist

Konyo's ruling — *"grok doesnt exist for dean.. it all needs to be claude based.. default as if
shadow is off toggled off"* — was ALREADY the built behaviour. Nothing was rebuilt. The only real
gap was that none of it reached the WIRE, so the card could not say which of the three states a
dark dot meant.

=== ⚠⚠ AVAILABILITY IS NOT A SECOND EYE, AND THIS FILE GUARDS THAT ===
A machine reporting a second family has a lane that COULD look. It has not looked. Only
`second_eye_ledger` records a look, and it refuses same-family ones on purpose so a model cannot
certify its own work. If a Claude run on Dean's box ever banked as a "second eye", the ledger would
report a filled seat that is empty — worse than no ledger at all.

    CHECK      any model, anywhere, including Claude on Dean's box. Bankable as a check.
    SECOND EYE a DIFFERENT family from the author. Where none exists the honest state is an
               EMPTY SEAT, said out loud.
