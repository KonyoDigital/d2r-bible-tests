"""v2735 — THE WIRE BETWEEN THE AUTOMATIC BACKUP AND THE DOOR THAT CAN PUT IT BACK.

Konyo: *"i want this automated not relying on the user.. i want a backup and restore point updated
and able to be repaired/restored thats why we coded all this already in parts just needs to be
wired properly."*

He was exactly right about the shape of it. MEASURED:

    BACKUP   automatic every 600s, all five ledgers + route, census-driven   ✅ v2731
    REBUILD  derives a chronicle from the other ledgers                      ✅ v2732
    DOORS    /api/chronicle_apply and /api/vault_apply — live, and the
             console UI already calls both                                   ✅
    RESTORE  ~/d2r_ledger_backups/restore_ledger.py — a manual CLI OUTSIDE
             the repo, dry-run by default, picking a file by HEURISTIC and
             never asking which profile                                      ❌ NOT WIRED

Nothing joined a backup file to those doors. The only "restore" reachable from the console was
`board_restore_dates`, which rewrites DATES on rows that still exist and cannot recover a loss.
[[the-unjoined-end]] [[plumbing-with-no-tap]]

=== WHY THIS IS SAFE TO BUILD NOW AND WAS NOT BEFORE ===
v2731 stamped the ROUTE into every backup file. Before that, a restore could only act on "whatever
board is currently showing" and nothing in the file would contradict a cross-world restore — the
Dean defect in reverse. Picking by route is now possible, so this refuses rather than guesses.

=== AND WHY THE APPLY IS ADDITIVE BY CONSTRUCTION ===
`chronicle_apply` routes through the board's own `window.chronicleApply`, which its own docstring
describes as "dated, merge-max, undoable". MERGE-MAX means a restore can only put back what is
missing; it cannot overwrite a newer find with an older one. So the dangerous direction — an old
snapshot clobbering good data — is closed by the door itself, not by a promise here.

⚠⚠ THIS MODULE WRITES NOTHING AND CANNOT. It reads backups, compares, and returns a PROPOSAL in the
shape the board already accepts (`{wouldAdd: {uniques, sets}}`). The console never writes the
ledger — every existing path asks the board to press its own door, and a second writer into his
chronicle is the drift this repo keeps finding.

⚠ THE RESTORE IS NOT AUTOMATIC, DELIBERATELY. "Able to be restored" is his phrase. The BACKUP is
the automated half and he never touches it; putting a ledger back is a deliberate act, and a plan
that ran itself could resurrect a state he had intentionally left behind.

# ══ HIS HAND-MADE STORES — WATCHED LIKE HIS LEDGER (#41 rank 5, 2026-09-29, REG-1481) ═══════════════
# His builds (the Character Builder) and his hand placements (the mule window) have travelled in the
# automatic backup since v2737 — `allStores` is the board's complete export — and NO watcher judged them:
# a wiped d2r_charBuilds opened no episode, raised nothing, and the prune could take the last file that
# held it. MEASURED read-only on his real backups (2026-09-29): the newest snapshot HOLDS d2r_charBuilds
# (1 build) and d2r_muleEquip; control_app and console_doctor had 0 matches for charBuilds / muleEquip.
# ⚠ THE SAME DROP LINE AS THE LEDGER, ON PURPOSE: to 0, or by >= max(DROP_MIN, DROP_FRAC x before).
# His own Delete + Undo of one build never pages (3 -> 2 is neither), while a wiped store opens an
# episode naming the file to restore from — and that file is then kept from the prune like any other.
# ⚠ COUNTED FROM `allStores`, WHERE EACH VALUE IS THE STORE'S OWN JSON TEXT as the board keeps it. There
# is no independent count for these (the board publishes none). WHAT IS UNKNOWN AND WHAT IS ZERO — the
# second eye on REG-1481 corrected the first cut here: `allStores` is `_collectProgress()`, which walks the
# RAW store END TO END (`for i < RAW.length`) for the active world, so a key ABSENT from a dict allStores
# was LOOKED FOR and not found — that is a measured 0, and it is exactly the shape the owner wipe leaves
# (`RAW.removeItem`, so the wiped store is not empty, it is GONE). Reading it as UNKNOWN made the watch
# blind to the one wipe that actually removes the key. Only NO allStores (not a dict: the board could not
# be asked) or text that is not a JSON dict/list stays None — "nobody looked" and "he had none" still
# never read the same. [[unknown-stays-unknown]] [[the-unjoined-end]]

#: any wipe that takes it takes charBuilds with it, which IS counted. Named here so its absence from
#: HAND_MADE reads as a decision, not an oversight.
HAND_MADE_POINTERS = ("cbMain",)
#: Where each hand-made store comes back from, in his words — the doctor prints this beside the episode.
#: None of them travels through the chronicle door (RESTORABLE) or an /api/*_restore door; the backup FILE
#: is the way back: its `allStores` is the board's own export (_collectProgress), so the store's exact text
#: is there to put back by hand, or wrapped as a grail-progress snapshot through Backup & Share.
#: ⚠ ONE KEY, NEVER THE WHOLE allStores (the second eye on REG-1481). `_applyProgress` setItem()s EVERY
#: string key it is handed, so importing the file's whole allStores puts back the builds AND rolls foundLog /
#: setPieces / owned / rwMade / gameFound back to that file's moment — every find since, discarded, behind a
#: confirm that only says "OVERWRITES the chronicle / wishlist / settings". A door that puts back more than
