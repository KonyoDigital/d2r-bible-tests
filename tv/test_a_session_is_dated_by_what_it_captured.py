"""REG-2736 (#86) - A SESSION IS ORDERED AND DATED BY WHAT IT CAPTURED, NOT BY WHEN SOMETHING WAS LAST WRITTEN ABOUT IT.

MEASURED on his journal 2026-10-28: the Shelf's first eight rows were September and October reels, and its LAST SESSION
digest named an October 10 reel - the KAI closer had re-closed them all morning (the REG-2728 loop) and each re-close
wrote rows with ts = today: kai-funnel receipts (with the frame's captureTs), the KAI closer's "closed the session" note
(ts and captureTs both today, dated from the session's newest row - the previous note - so 59 re-closes walked one
September reel to today) and the watchdog's verdict. split_sessions ordered sessions by their newest ts, and the row
took t0/t1 from the first and last ts, so one reel read a 17-day span (readMs 1,490,631,272).

A row's moment is its frame's capture time when it carries one (replay.row_moment); the KAI ledger and the watchdog
annotate a session after it and are left out of its moments (POST_HOC_LANES), every row counting only when nothing else
is there - and a re-read row with no capture time is never one, even then (REG-2752: such a reel reads UNKNOWN).
Driven on replay.split_sessions and the real Handler._theatre_sessions over a fixture journal and reel tree.
RED_PROOF below.
