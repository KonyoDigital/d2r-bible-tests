"""#158.8 (REG-2815) - A READER THAT REFUSED (ITS CAP, AN ERROR BODY) IS NEVER COUNTED AS A READ.

The task: "a subscription cap hit returns HTTP 200 + an error body, so callers can't tell it from a read." MEASURED at
v3832: control_app's /api/intake already answers a cap with 429 (REG-2383/2388) - that half is closed. The callers were
not: the Chronicle screenshot reader and the grail screenshot reader parsed the cap's body and read its empty lists as a
page or a shot read with nothing on it; the Ask box showed the error as the bible's answer; the set tracker, the craft
reader and the item checker's upload read a 200 + {error} (the website path, v407) the same way; and the item checker's
judge answered a cap "server 429" beside "no magic/rare item readable", which the engine's judge loop posted to
/kai_verdict as a "kai-judge" receipt - "judge a tooltip - UNREADABLE" - that _judge_already_near then read as "this hover
was judged", so the cap stood in for a read and the hover was never judged.

One rule now, window._intakeRefused(status, body), beside the one intake door: every door asks it. aicJudge answers a
refusal as {ok:false, refused:true, why}, and /kai_verdict journals it under its own mode (_kai_refused_row), which no
judge reader takes for a judge.

Driven: the rule and aicJudge cut out of bible.html and run in node; _kai_refused_row and _judge_already_near called on
control_app itself; each door's use of the rule read at its one-line site. RED_PROOF below.
