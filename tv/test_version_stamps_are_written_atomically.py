"""v2712 — THE WRITE THAT RUNS ON EVERY SHIP LEFT HIS 6 MB BOARD AT ZERO BYTES.

His diagnosis, 2026-09-05: *"it happens i think in a form of stale render ... something like
unsyncs and it needs a restart or something to fetch it"* — given about panels that render NOTHING
and say nothing, and that never reproduce afterwards.

THE MECHANISM, MEASURED. `bump_version.bump()` wrote all four version stamps with
`io.open(path, "w").write(text)`. That call TRUNCATES ON OPEN, so between the truncate and the
write completing the file on disk is EMPTY. bible.html is 6 MB and his console EXECS THE WORKING
TREE — it re-reads that file per request — so a page load landing in that window parses nothing.

    truncate-then-write    188 reads,  9 TORN  (4.8%)   every torn size == 0 bytes
    tmp + os.replace       203 reads,  0 TORN  (0.0%)

The torn reads were not partial parses. They were an EMPTY FILE. That is exactly the symptom, and
it explains why every attempt to reproduce it FAILED: a settled tree is fine, so reproducing on one
measures the wrong moment. [[feedback-blind-fixture-green-gate]] [[execs-the-working-tree]]

=== WHY THIS GATE IS DETERMINISTIC AND NOT A RACE ===
The obvious test — two threads, count torn reads — is exactly the test that goes green on a fast
machine for the wrong reason and reads as proof. A concurrency gate whose CONTROL can silently
fail to reproduce the defect is a gate that certifies nothing on the day it matters, and this repo
has been bitten by the green-that-lies often enough to know better. [[regression-guard]]

So the property is proven WITHOUT a race, both ways:
  * the CONTROL opens the old call and observes size 0 before one byte of content is written —
    the defect, demonstrated with no timing dependence at all;
  * the FIX observes the target at the instant before the swap and finds the OLD file intact.

⚠ WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, stated so it is not mistaken for more: atomicity is PER FILE. A crash
between two of the four stamps still leaves the set disagreeing. That is a different defect and
nothing here fixes it. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
