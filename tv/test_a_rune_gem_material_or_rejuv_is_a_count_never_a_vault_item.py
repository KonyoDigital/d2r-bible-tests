"""REG-2899 (his words 2026-10-28 ~20:40) - A RUNE, A GEM, A MATERIAL OR A REJUVENATION POTION IS A COUNT IN ITS OWN TALLY,
NEVER A VAULT ITEM WITH A MULE CELL.

His words: "gems will eventually move to the shared stash so they are not relevant when seen in inventory/stash they have
their own designated area runes/gems/materials/rejuvination potions they are automatically going to go to the ingame
designated area we also have those same templates already designed in the console with their tallies".

Measured on the whole page in node before the fix: a gem was Unsorted (REG-2857 said "a gem the Gem Stash counts" but
kept no home), a rejuvenation potion and a key named nothing at the router, "Key of Terror" was OWNED through + Add an
item (a catalogue lists it), and the register door owned runes and gems it read. Now one rule (_stashTallyOf, from the
board's own tables - RUNES, GEM_TYPES, MAT_TAB_LAYOUT) says which tally counts it, and every door reads it:
  * the router answers the shared stash (its own area), never a mule and never Unsorted; the proposal says which tally;
  * the hand door refuses it, naming that tally, and owns nothing - even a catalogue-listed key;
  * the register door refuses it (a rune, a gem, a rejuvenation potion; a material in its own words, REG-158.4);
  * SHARED_STASH_RE's gem and Materials-tab names equal the tables, and the console doctor reads the same line;
  * a Sunder charm (a unique the vault keeps) and Rune Sword (a base) are not counts.

Driven on the whole page in node (vault_page_node), fixtures only; the console doctor's half in Python. RED_PROOF below.
