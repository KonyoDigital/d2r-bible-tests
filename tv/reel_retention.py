"""v2001 — WHICH FOOTAGE HAS GIVEN UP ITS INFORMATION, AND MAY THEREFORE GO.

Konyo: "for storage optimization ... it should delete the oldest and older reel session after it
analyzes them and ledgers them and registers and they all get funneled properly as they should and
are." And, on keying it to swept + evidence banked: "its fine".

MEASURED FIRST, ON HIS 31 REELS (2026-08-23), because the obvious rule is the wrong one:

    read — evidence banked (pages>0)      6 reels    254 MB
    SEALED WITH 0 PAGES                  12 reels   1166 MB
    never swept                          13 reels   1058 MB

"Delete what has been swept" would take 18 reels and 1420 MB — and 1166 MB of that was **never
actually read**. A 0-page seal does not mean "done"; it means THIS READER FOUND NOTHING, and the
engine already knows it, because it reopens exactly those on its own:

    "🔓 8 reel(s) reopened - sealed with 0 pages by an older reader (now p1839)"

So the safe rule is the inverse of the obvious one: a reel is a candidate only once it has GIVEN
something up. Footage that has yielded nothing yet is the footage most worth keeping.

THE FIVE BARS, and every one of them exists because deleting his film cannot be undone:

  1. EVIDENCE BANKED     chronicle_swept says pages > 0. A 0-page seal is a re-read candidate.
  2. BOTH LANES SEALED   chronicle AND vault. A reel the vault has never swept still owes the vault
                         manager its stash rows, and vault_swept.json does not exist at all today —
                         which is why this reports ZERO candidates on his machine right now, and
                         that is the correct answer rather than a broken one.
  3. KEEP THE RECENT     the newest KEEP_RECENT reels stay whatever their state, so a bad sweep can
                         always be re-run against real footage.
  4. OLDEST FIRST        his words. It frees space in the order he asked for.
  5. FLOOR               it stops as soon as the target is met; it never empties the shelf.

IT DOES NOT DELETE UNLESS ASKED. `plan()` is pure and `main()` prints. Deletion needs --apply, and
--apply refuses without --yes, because the one thing worse than a full disk is a confident script
that removed the only copy of a Ber drop. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

    ⚠⚠ v2875 — THE `zero-pages` RULE HOLDS REELS FOR AN EVENT THAT CANNOT HAPPEN.

    Konyo, 2026-09-10: *"whatever doesn have information on the reels get filtered anyways and go
    to tombstone eventually within the filtering system and process"*.

    `zero-pages` says "sealed with 0 pages — the engine reopens these when the prompt improves".
    That is exactly right for footage that CONTAINS a Chronicle screen the reader failed to read.
    It is meaningless for footage that has none: no future prompt can find a page in a reel where
    the Chronicle was never on screen, so the reel is held for ever by a verdict from a lane that
    was never the right one for it.

    MEASURED on his tree, 2026-09-10:
        41 reels on disk, retention holding them as   zero-pages 25 · test-fixture 8 · recent 8
        2,437 panel frames across those reels (36% of all footage)
        kinds: stash 1855 · shared 407 · personal 121 · materials 40 · runes 10 · gems 4
        chronicle: ZERO — and across ALL 454 surveyed reels in his store, never once
    `retro_triage.PANEL_KINDS` carries 'chronicle', so the survey CAN say it and never has. Those
    25 reels are stash footage, and their stash rows are the VAULT lane's work — which the chain
    never reaches, because `zero-pages` matches first. The file predicted this: "the vault-owes tag
    genuinely never fires on his tree because earlier rules match first... a LATENT defect the day
    a reel legitimately reaches it."

    ⚠ THIS DOES NOT DELETE ANYTHING. It only stops a chronicle verdict from being the reason, so
    the reel falls through to the rules that actually apply to it — rows-not-banked, vault-owes,
    the receipt hold. Every one of those can still keep it.

    ⚠ NOT SURVEYED IS NOT "NO CHRONICLE". A missing store, an unreadable one, a reel absent from
    it, a SAMPLED pass, or any exception all return False — which KEEPS the chronicle hold. Same
    doctrine as _proven_empty, for the same reason: the cost of being wrong is footage with no

# getting delted after the 8 sessions"* — and #255: *"getting pruned and extracted data wise and
# eventually tombstones to get deleted.. that way storage is always smooth and optimized and not
# stacking up"*.
#
# ⚠⚠ WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE A LINE OF THIS WAS WRITTEN, because the brief's root cause did not
# survive the measurement. It said the pass only frees under disk pressure. Read against the code
# and against his live console (GET /api/status, 2026-09-27, 11.8 GB free): above floor+headroom
# the pass has asked for NO target since v2226, and his console reported `eligible: 0` — 19 reel
# dirs = 8 test fixtures + the newest 8 + 3 held `panels-never-banked` (sealed barren, rows 0).
# His drain was at its floor, CORRECTLY. The real defect was the BAND: at or below floor+headroom
# the pass handed plan() `free_mb=need_mb`, so the moment the disk got tight it stopped after
# `need_mb` and held every other finished reel as `target-met` — disk pressure freed LESS than no
# pressure. That band is where his disk is heading (down 0.6 GB/day).
#
# ⚠ AND NOTHING WATCHED THE MOUTH. shelf_driver declares the `deleter` lane with `boundS: None`, so a
# drain that stopped with reels owed could only ever read UNTIMED — never STALLED — and a wall-clock
# bound would cry wolf the first pass after a quiet week. The honest unit is the PASS: a working
# pass releases every reel it plans in that same pass, so a reel still owed through two whole
# passes that released nothing is a drain that has stopped, not one that is slow.
# [[heart-first]] [[the-unjoined-end]] [[feedback-contradiction-is-the-finding]]

#: How many consecutive passes may carry releasable reels forward before the drain is STOPPED.
#: The brief's own bar — "owed > 0 for longer than two passes" — so the THIRD pass that still owes
#: and released nothing fires. Derive from this in tests; never hardcode 3. [[regression-guard]] §4

    #84 (REG-1517) — MEASURED ON THE ALT, 2026-09-29: 126 reels, river EMPTY 91 / PRINTER 33 (all
    unsealed, `reel.route` CLOSED — "the heart has never run here"), and retention.drain said
    {state: CLEAR, owed: 0, why: "drained — every reel that cleared every bar ... nothing is owed"}.
    drain_owed() counts the plan's CANDIDATES, and a reel held at EMPTY or PRINTER is not one — so
    the drain counted only the reels that had reached ITS stage and called the other 110 nothing.
    Every word of CLEAR was true of the mouth and false of the river. [[heart-first]] §2: on is not
    working, and "nothing owed at my stage" is not "nothing owed".

    `last`      river_stamp.last_stamps(): reel -> its last stamp row (`station`, `at`). None = the
                store would not read = UNKNOWN, never an empty river. THE POSITION IS QUOTED FROM
                HERE AND NEVER RE-DERIVED — the router is the authority on where a reel is, the
                stamp store is its record, and a second derivation here would be [[copy-drift]].
    `plan`      THIS pass's plan(): candidates + kept are the shelf, and a `test-fixture` tag names
                a reel pinned by the suite, which waits on no lane and is never counted.
    `upstream`  the stations a LANE is meant to move a reel out of. The console passes its own
                _RIVER_OWNER keys — CAPTURE is not among them because it waits on a capture change
                by design (REG-340) and is never an alarm; those reels are counted BESIDE `n` in
                `byDesign`, never inside it. None = every station before ROUTED, no exemption.
    `why_of`    station -> the owning lane's own last word (control_app._river_stuck_why), quoted
                for the "behind <lock/reason>" half of the sentence. None = no reason available.
    `after_s`   the bar the doctor holds `oldestS` against (control_app.RIVER_STUCK_AFTER_S);
                carried as `afterS` so the row never hardcodes it. None = no bar declared.

       complete    False when an older reel has no readable position (`unplaced`: never stamped;

       oldestS     how long the longest-waiting blocked reel has sat at its station, from the
