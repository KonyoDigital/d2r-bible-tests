"""No child process of the console may open a window on Windows.

HIS REPORT, 2026-09-26: "on windows specifically a window terminal keeps jumping up and alt tabbing me and even
deans computer.. because the console its refreshing and like fetching data or something it has some background
process that jumps all the time and exits us from the game.. i need this hidden... no window should be opening".

THE MECHANISM. The console runs as pythonw.exe - no console of its own. A console-subsystem child it starts (git,
powershell, schtasks, tasklist, python.exe, ffmpeg ...) therefore gets a NEW console window unless the spawn passes
CREATE_NO_WINDOW; the window appears, takes focus, and pulls him out of a full-screen game. git_quiet.py fixed the git
spawns one door at a time; MEASURED the same night by a static sweep, 82 spawn sites across 38 tv/ modules pass no
creationflags at all - 24 of them in the three modules that run on his Windows machine every tick (control_app 10,
tv_diablo 8, console_doctor 6). Fixing 82 call sites one by one would miss the 83rd.

SO THIS IS THE DOOR, NOT A SITE. subprocess.run / call / check_output / check_call all construct `Popen` from the
subprocess module's own globals, so replacing `subprocess.Popen` once - first thing in each Windows process - covers
every spawn that exists and every one written later. [[heart-first]] rule 4: instrument at the door.

WHAT IT DOES, only on win32: every child gets CREATE_NO_WINDOW and a STARTUPINFO with SW_HIDE - UNLESS the caller
asked for a window on purpose (CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE, or DETACHED_PROCESS, both meaningful choices), which is respected.
Anywhere else it does nothing and says so. It never changes arguments, pipes, env or cwd.
