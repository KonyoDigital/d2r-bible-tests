"""REG-2987 (#172, his priority 1: "the ALT's free memory keeps falling") - THE EAGLE'S PASS RUNS IN A SHORT-LIVED CHILD.

MEASURED 2026-10-29 (REG-2985's spike profile, a scratch console of his Mac, his data, Python 3.9): with the source parses
gone, every RSS spike past 450 MB sat inside the eagle's in-process console_doctor.run - corroborate's readings, the eye
audit, the run census, the evidence tiers, health_engine.report. GrokBot on the ALT (v3836): free memory 1.5 GB -> 689 MB ->
560 MB over an hour. A console now asks the pass of a child (audit_child.doctor_rows) and asks only console_doctor.IN_PROCESS
itself - the rows that read the process they run in. The rules, one case each:
  - every check whose code reads its own process (_serving_console, os.getpid, sys.modules, a boot record the console sets
    on the doctor, a module memo it keeps across ticks) is IN_PROCESS - read off the code, never a list kept by hand;
  - a part of a pass asks only its part, and the console's part primes no per-tick cache;
  - a real child answers the same rows this process does for the same checks;
  - a child that fails, times out, writes nothing or writes another ask's rows is UNKNOWN - never served, never derived in
    the console; one pass at a time;
  - the eagle on a console asks the child, then IN_PROCESS itself, in roster order; a child that does not answer leaves the
    pass UNKNOWN with no rows; off a console (a law, CI, a CLI) the whole pass runs in its own process as before.
Never a browser, never his console: the child is pointed at a closed port. RED_PROOF below.
