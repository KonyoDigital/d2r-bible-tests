"""REG-1686 - A RED-PROOF THAT NEEDS WHAT THIS PC LACKS IS ELSEWHERE, NEVER BLIND.

MEASURED on his ALT 2026-10-01 ~16:45: the census filed test_the_character_builder_is_their_builder BLIND on proofs [9]
and [10] (20 of 22 PROVEN). Both tamper the builder's generator, and the one case that drives the generator skips on a PC
with no local D2R install - the ALT plays through a cloud client - in the clean run AND the tampered one, so the tampered
run stayed green about nothing. That single BLIND record shut every lock on the ALT (reel.route, printer.stream,
vault.sweep_start, frame.release all answered "1 instrument(s) are BLIND"), so the river stopped again.

Driven through the REAL heart2._prove_one / _prove_gate (only the law runs and the host probe are stand-ins):
  1. a proof that declares `"needs"` a capability this PC lacks is ELSEWHERE and its law is never run here;
  2. where the PC has it, the proof is judged exactly as before (it can still go BLIND);
  3. a capability name no probe knows is INVALID - a typo never excuses a proof;
  4. a gate is PROVEN when its other proofs are and the rest are ELSEWHERE; every proof ELSEWHERE is UNPROVABLE here;
     a BLIND among them stays BLIND;
  5. the builder law's [9] and [10] declare the install; the install probe is the ONE rule _pull itself checks.
  6. REG-2354 - a proof whose every law skipped in BOTH runs, on a PC with no node, for a gate that reaches for node, is
     ELSEWHERE; with node, with laws that ran, or with a gate that never names node, it is BLIND exactly as before.
     MEASURED on Dean's PC 2026-10-21: 53 of its 56 BLIND were that shape, and 0 of its 9 locks were permitted;
  7. "node" and "bash" answer from PATH, the question the laws' own skips ask;
  8. a BLIND filed under an older BLIND_RULE is owed again though its file is unchanged, a slice takes it off the list
     whatever it finds, and self_prove reads a census that still carries one as stale.
  9. REG-2359 (round 3) - 6's skips must be NODE's: a reason that is not node's (his D2R install, his footage), one such
     reason among node's, a skip the watch did not see, or no watch at all is BLIND as before, and the ELSEWHERE line
     says only what was measured. The reasons come from the run itself - gate_trace's skip watch, at any verbosity, the
     run's own process only - driven over a real fixture law.
 10. REG-2357 (round 3) - a proof of a law whose every case skips off POSIX, declaring no need, is INVALID where it can
     be judged (it files BLIND on Windows); declared, it is judged on POSIX and ELSEWHERE on Windows; a law with one
     case that runs on Windows is judged as before; a proof caught only by off-POSIX cases is said, never refused. The
     off-POSIX reader is driven over every skip shape it must tell apart.
