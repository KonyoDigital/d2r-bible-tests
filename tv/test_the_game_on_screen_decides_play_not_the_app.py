"""REG-1666 - a cloud client is play only while the GAME is on his screen; the game itself is play while it runs.

His words, 2026-10-01: "it needs to like register when im ingame and playing not just when its open", and "make sure
this logic is known to all routes... like nvidea play and also the local way of playing the game the way dean usually
plays on his PC". MEASURED on his ALT that morning: the self-prove lane read Boosteroid as "playing" from 02:29 to 10:49
(178 proofs owed) while the shadow watch said the launcher was on screen, and the app in the tray held 2,190 MB private
bytes - more than a live stream - so no memory bar could ever tell idle from playing.

THE ROUTES, each driven below:
  - the game itself, D2R.exe (Battle.net on his PC and on Dean's, CrossOver on the Mac): play while it runs, at its
    menu too - exclusive fullscreen can hide its window from the walk. Battle.net alone is a launcher, never play.
  - Boosteroid: the tray (no window) and the launcher (no D2R HUD word in the first reads) are not play; the game is.
  - GeForce NOW: its library (a window that does not name the game) is not play; a stream titled with the game is.
  - nobody could look, the look is stale, the shadow reader is off: a cloud client counts as playing (never a guess).

The one judge of "is the game on his screen" is the shadow watch (control_app); the prover asks it through
_sp_playing_here. The Windows process walk is the real tv_diablo._toolhelp_any over a stubbed kernel32; the Mac
listing is a stubbed `ps`. Nothing here touches his machine.

RED_PROOF below.
