"""ONE REEL IS ONE SESSION ROW — however its journal rows interleave with another reel's.

⚠⚠ THE DEFECT THIS REFUSES BROKE PLAYBACK, NOT JUST A COUNT. `split_sessions` used to cut a new
session whenever `sessionId` differed from the IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING row. Two reels recording
concurrently interleave by timestamp, so A,B,A emitted THREE groups and one reel became several
"sessions". Straight from his journal:

    run 2425  s_1787522893554_13522   101 rows
    run 2426  s_1787523300658_1         3 rows
    run 2427  s_1787522893554_13522     3 rows      <- the same reel again
    run 2428  s_1787523300658_1         2 rows

Each fragment then carried its own SHARE of the frames, so one reel read `frames=10` in one row
and `frames=0` in another while 19 stills sat on disk. Konyo opened the row that said 0:
*"i cant seem to play it like a video style ... it let me snapcheck with the arrows"*. The player
asked that row what to play and was told nothing; the arrow stepper reads the reel directly and
worked. It is also why the card said `19 frames · full video` and the dossier said `0 FRAMES`.

MEASURED on his journal (11,162 rows): 3,129 contiguous runs → 3,128 session rows, 176 sessionIds
occupying more than one run, worst reel 16.

⚠ THE UNSTAMPED HISTORY KEEPS THE OLD RULE and this file pins that too. Rows with no sessionId
predate v780 and have nothing to group ON; grouping them by absence would fuse years into one
session. [[the-unjoined-end]] [[label-outlived-referent]]
