"""#86 gap audit 26 (REG-1778) — A SWEEP THAT NEVER BANKED A READ IS NOT AN UNKNOWN AGE.

The reel-extract row took the sweep memory's mtime whenever reels still owed a read. Any failure,
including a file that was never written, came back UNKNOWN ("its age is unknown"). An unknown is
not counted, so a console that has never banked a read looked like one whose clock could not be
read.

  · DRIVEN: no chronicle_swept.json, one reel on a fixture shelf -> MISSING, and the sentence
    says no read has ever been banked. Not the age sentence.
  · DRIVEN: the file is there and will not stat -> UNKNOWN, and a retained read is still named.
  · DRIVEN: a bank that exists is still the age rule. Fresh stays the loop working. Older than
    two hours stays MISSING for that age, not for a memory that was never written.
Nothing here reads his sweep memory or his shelf. RED_PROOF below. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
