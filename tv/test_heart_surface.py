    `.fx-body` is a two-column grid belonging to the fleet window. #ver-xref reused .fleet-xref /
    .fxr-win to BE the cross-reference window rather than a lookalike, inherited the grid, and had
    to override it — and wrote a warning saying so. v2443 added #heart-ov the same way, three lines
    under that warning, and inherited the same bug: measured at 1440 the diagram was squeezed to its
    640px min-width, THE VALVES were stranded in a right-hand column, and a horizontal scrollbar
    ran under the whole panel.

    So this pins the LAW, not the two panels that exist today: ANY element reusing the fleet shell
    must carry the override. A test naming #heart-ov would go stale the next time someone reuses
    .fleet-xref — which is exactly how this defect arrived the second time.

    """★ Konyo: "the shelf is kinda of a trapped area when clicked i cant really get out of it..
    where is the logic of close theatre mode or close the shelf.. something there is meshing up"

    MEASURED, all four ways out, from a real shelf-open state — NOT ONE closed both layers:

        the shelf's own ✕          shelf SHUT        stage STILL OPEN
        the Close Theatre button   shelf STILL OPEN  stage SHUT
        Escape                     shelf SHUT        stage STILL OPEN
        clicking THE SHELF again   nothing at all    nothing at all

    ⚠ AND THIS RETRACTED AN EARLIER DIAGNOSIS. His "black empty panel" was attributed to a
    rejected thOpen() swallowing the shelf. That defect was real, but THIS reproduces every time:
    ✕ or Escape closed the shelf and left him on the bare stage one layer down.

    ⚠ TWO WRONG FIXES BEFORE THE RIGHT ONE, both kept in the comments because the second looked
    more principled than the first and was not:
      1. a TH.shelfIsDoor flag set at the door — wrong for the flow he uses (door -> open a reel ->
         peek at the shelf -> ✕ would have thrown him out of the reel)
      2. "does the stage have a reel loaded" — sounds better, measured worse: opening the theatre
         AUTO-LOADS the last session, so a reel is always loaded even straight through the door.
         Having a reel is not the same as having asked for one.
    The flag is right; it just has to be CLEARED where its meaning changes — thLoadSession, the
    moment he opens a reel.
