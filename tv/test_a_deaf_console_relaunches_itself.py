"""#71 — A CONSOLE THAT CANNOT ANSWER ITS OWN PORT NOTICES, AND RELAUNCHES ITSELF (REG-1435).

2026-09-29 ~03:10: his Mac console had run 24 h with its window up and :17772 in LISTEN (queue 0/0/5), and every
request was accepted and reset. The fleet read "unreachable", THE SHELF would not open, W did nothing, TV·D said
"Control server unreachable". He found it from four screenshots; nothing in the console did, because every watchdog it
has talks to it over that same port. Relaunched by hand, it came back healthy.

DRIVEN with REAL loopback sockets (an ephemeral port per case, never :17772):
  · a server that answers -> "answered"; one that accepts and closes without a word -> "reset" (the deaf shape);
    a closed port -> "refused"; one that accepts and never answers -> "timeout"
  · three refusals in a row relaunch the console once; an answer clears the strikes; a TIMEOUT neither counts nor
    clears (the ALT stalls for minutes under load - slow is not deaf); a second relaunch waits ten minutes
  · the rescue loop asks, on its own tick (no new thread)
RED_PROOF below.
