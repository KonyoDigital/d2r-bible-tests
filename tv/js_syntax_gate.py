"""v1476 — SYNTAX GATE for the single-file surfaces (bible.html · control_ui.html).

Why this exists
---------------
Twice in one session an edit produced a hard `Uncaught SyntaxError` that killed an entire
37k-line page, and both times it was caught only because a human happened to run headless
Chromium by hand:

  REG-060  a shell heredoc ate `\\n` escapes, leaving REAL newlines inside single-quoted JS
           string literals -> unterminated string.
  REG-072  a `//` comment was appended MID-LINE to a single-line `forEach`, commenting out the
           rest of the statement -> the closing `});` vanished.

Either one blanks the whole board. A manual check is one bad day away from shipping, so it
belongs in the suite.

Why a real browser and not a hand-rolled scanner
-----------------------------------------------
A tokenizer was tried first and REJECTED. On this codebase it reported 14-16 problems in files
that parse perfectly in Chromium: the pages use template literals with `${…}` interpolation
containing nested backticks, embedded HTML with quotes, and regex literals that a heuristic
cannot reliably tell from division. A gate with false alarms is worse than no gate — people stop
reading it, and then it misses the real one. So the gate asks an actual JavaScript engine.

Behaviour
---------
  * Chromium available -> load each file and fail on any SyntaxError in the console.
  * Chromium missing   -> SKIP loudly. A gate that cannot run must say so, never pass silently.

    subprocess.run's timeout path kills the LAUNCHER and then calls communicate() again to drain
    the pipes. Chrome always forks renderer/GPU/zygote helpers that INHERIT the stdout pipe, and
    at least one of them reparents to launchd (measured: pid with PPID 1 alive while the launcher
    was gone). Killing the launcher therefore never closes the write end, so that second
    communicate() blocks forever — TimeoutExpired is raised in theory and never reached in practice.

    MEASURED on this Mac, 2026-09-20: test_control sat at the same byte for 10+ minutes at 0.0%
    CPU; two faulthandler dumps 120s apart named the identical frame — js_syntax_gate.check ->
    subprocess.run -> communicate -> selectors.select, under

    exact tree measure 507-564s against a 1500s bound (2.66x margin), so the bound was never the
    defect and must NOT be raised for this.

    THE CURE ALREADY EXISTED AND WAS NEVER JOINED HERE. tv/test_control.py:129 `_reap()` was

    session, so ONE killpg reaches the renderer grandchildren that hold the stdout pipe open."
    js_syntax_gate referenced it zero times. This is that discipline, applied at the launch site.

                    # the file's correctness.

                    # there genuinely no verdict, and then it is reported as a skip rather than a

                    #     ones — so a genuine syntax error found in bible.html would vanish the
                    #     moment control_ui.html timed out with no node available. A gate that

                    #
                    # (2) "Cannot verify" is now a PROBLEM, not a silent skip. This gate exists to
                    #     stop a blank page shipping; when neither engine can answer for a file,
                    #     fail closed and name it. It does not reintroduce the flake this fallback
                    #     was written for, because that flake is a SLOW browser and CI installs
