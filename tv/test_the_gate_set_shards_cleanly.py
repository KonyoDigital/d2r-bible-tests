"""v3472 (#184) — the gate set splits into slices that are DISJOINT, COMPLETE and the SAME everywhere.

⚠ WHY: the agent-suite ran 25m18s against its 25-minute ceiling on d9bdb682 and was CANCELLED — the
shipped version got no verdict. CI now runs `run_gates.py --shard K/N` as a matrix. A slice that
drops a gate is a gate that silently never runs; two slices sharing one is a ceiling paid twice; a
slice that differs between machines is a verdict nobody can reproduce. And an EMPTY slice is worse
than all three: `run()` treats `[]` as "every gate".

DRIVEN against the real registry; nothing here reads source text. RED_PROOF below.
