"""#203 - A SLOW CHARACTER READ STILL REACHES THE SHADOW, AND A MISS IS NAMED.

GrokBot's shadow debug, bug 1 (#230, 2026-10-27): the ALT's uploads at 21:27 and 21:53 carried no
d2r_api_chars_learned. The profile publish asked the console's own /api/chars_learned with an 8 s timeout, the ALT takes
4.7-14 s to answer, and a timeout was dropped without a word - so the shadow's Characters said "UNKNOWN - ledger could
not be read" and the builder's picker lost KonyoBear, KonyoRabbies, Konylock and Konyodin.

Driven through the real _profile_publish_once with only the network and the reads stubbed:
  - the upload's answer is built in this process with only the fields it keeps (no loopback, no status() frame glob),
    and it is not built at all on a tick inside the 75 min gap;
  - a read that answers is uploaded and kept on disk in this PC's log root;
  - a read that misses later sends that last good answer and says so in .roster_profile_state.json (apiMiss);
  - a miss with no good answer in PROFILE_API_KEEP_S is named and uploads nothing for that answer.
  - GrokBot bug 6: the Characters room says it is asking while the console answers (node, the whole page).
RED_PROOF below.
