"""A BUTTON THAT CORRECTLY DOES NOTHING MUST SAY SO, OR IT READS AS BROKEN.

Konyo, twice: *"its not even sorting them.. only some"*, and at a screenshot of the Vault,
*"stlll the vault"*. The dock showed a COUNT and an **Auto-Sort to Mules** button. He pressed it,
nothing moved, and nothing on screen said why.

MEASURED on his board, 2026-09-17: of 219 in the pool, **173 are filed and all 46 unsorted carry
exactly one suggestion — `__throwout`**. Auto-Sort will not act on that, because throwing his
items away is his decision and never automatic. So the button correctly does nothing and the dock
correctly keeps them.

**Both halves were right and the screen said neither.** A number with no reason beside a button
that does nothing is indistinguishable from a broken sorter — which is exactly what he reported,
twice. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]] [[the-unjoined-end]]

⚠ This runs the SHIPPED block in node against a stubbed `suggestMule`, rather than asserting the
text is present. The sentence is not the law; what the sentence is derived FROM is.
