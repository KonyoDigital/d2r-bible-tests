"""v2471 — THE PAGE MAY ONLY HIDE ITS OWN NAV WHEN SOMETHING ELSE IS PROVABLY CARRYING IT.

⚠ THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. Konyo, 2026-09-03, with a screenshot of an empty header band:
"i cant see any tabs... something is bugged". Measured on his build: `.tabs` computed
`display:none`, 0 of 19 tab buttons laid out, body carrying `app-ctx engine-driven`.

`?engine=1` is written in exactly ONE place in this repo — the `#tvd-eng` IFRAME in
tv/control_ui.html — and the rule it arms is:

    body.app-ctx.engine-driven .tabs { display:none !important }

whose own comment states the theory: "console header is the one clickable rail". True inside the
shell. Open that same URL as a top-level window and the flag still arms, the rail is not there,
and the document hides its navigation in favour of nothing. The flag was a CLAIM ABOUT CONTEXT and
nothing ever checked the context. [[the-unjoined-end]]

TWO LAWS, both pinned here, neither pinned to a number or a roster:

  1. The `engine-driven` CLASS is only added when the document is genuinely framed. Every site
     that adds it must test `window.top !== window.self`. (`ENGINE_DRIVEN` the VARIABLE is
     deliberately NOT gated — it also decides whether this page arms its own intake poll, and
     loosening that would let a top-level pane double-arm against the control process.)

  2. Every tab re-shown in app context lives in `.tabs-workshop`. `body.app-ctx .tabs-data
     {display:none}` hides the container holding `main` + the HUNT and LORE clusters, which would
     otherwise paint as empty captioned boxes. That is correct ONLY while law 2 holds — so if
     someone re-shows a data tab by name, this goes red instead of the tab silently vanishing,
     which is the exact trap the v2084 comment in bible.html warns about.

          1. ITS DETECTOR SAW ONE CALL SHAPE. It matched the literal
             `classList.add('engine-driven')`, so rewriting a site to
             `classList.toggle('engine-driven', <test>)`, to `className += ' engine-driven'`, or

             restored and a top-level board back to 0 of 19 tabs.
          2. ITS ASSERTION CHECKED PRESENCE, NOT CONTROL. It asked whether the framing test
             appeared anywhere in the enclosing scope. Leaving `var _framed = window.top !==
             window.self` in place as a DEAD VARIABLE while dropping `&& _framed` from the
             condition — the most ordinary kind of regression — also passed.

        So it now finds every WRITE of the class by any mechanism, and requires the framing test
        inside the CONTROLLING CONDITION of each: resolved transitively through same-file function
        calls AND through local `var x = …` assignments, so a variable only counts when the
