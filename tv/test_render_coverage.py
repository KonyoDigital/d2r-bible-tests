"""v2475 — the render gate can now notice its own coverage shrinking.

⚠ THE GAP THIS CLOSES, in TASKS.md's own words under STILL OWED BY ME:

    "The render gate does not cover what I changed. The `console` target went 3/3 -> 2/2 when a
     control was hidden and RE-BASELINED SILENTLY... Unmeasured reads identical to clean in a
     green run."

That is tv/render_check.py's own thesis turned on itself. It refuses a zero-size element, a black
capture, an unsettled page, a dropped socket — every way ONE reading can lie — and had no way to
notice it was taking FEWER readings than before. A control that disappears takes its own check with
it, and two clean measurements are two clean measurements.

The ratchet is tv/swallow_census.py's, INVERTED: that one counts a defect and may only fall; this
counts COVERAGE and may only rise.

⚠ WHAT I COULD NOT ESTABLISH, said plainly rather than guessed. The console target's selector has
been `#btn-mini, #btn-miniauto` since it was introduced in v2378 — measured with
`git log -L '/"sel": "#btn-mini/,+1:tv/render_check.py'`, one commit, no edits. So the 3 -> 2 drop
was a change in the DOM, not in the spec: two ID selectors matching three nodes means a duplicate
id existed, and losing it was most likely a FIX rather than a loss. I did not confirm that, so the
floor blessed today records 2 and this file does not claim to know what the third node was.
The ratchet stops the NEXT silent drop; it cannot recover one that already happened.
