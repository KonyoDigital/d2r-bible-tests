"""#172 PHASE B - A SOURCE AUDIT RUNS IN A SHORT-LIVED CHILD, SO ITS PARSE MEMORY LEAVES WITH THE CHILD.

MEASURED 2026-10-27 (#172, a private console on a no-.git copy of his main tree, 150 s, tracemalloc): the console spent
its memory PARSING ITS OWN SOURCE. chronicle_routes.routes() read ~1,400 tv/*.py, held 45.8 MB of decommented text and
ast.parsed them all (939k objects); health_engine._lane_spans() ast.parsed the 49k-line control_app.py (930k objects).
ast.parse builds C-level arenas tracemalloc does not see, and the freed big blocks stay resident: vmmap on his Mac showed
1.2 GB of freed-but-resident MALLOC_LARGE 55 s after a start, and the ALT kept 1.28 GB private on 7.9 GB. Phase A
(REG-2638, v3812) memoised the per-file parses; this is the first parse after an update.

    python3 audit_child.py routes        # derives chronicle_routes.routes() and writes its own disk cache
    python3 audit_child.py lane_spans    # derives health_engine's lane spans and writes LANE_SPANS_CACHE
    python3 audit_child.py red_proofs    # every gate file's RED_PROOF list (heart2.red_proofs_in), per file stamp
    python3 audit_child.py swallow ROOT  # the swallow census's rows of every .py under ROOT, per file stamp
    python3 audit_child.py doctor OUT NONCE TICK SLOW PERIODIC CONSOLE [ONLY]   # the eagle's pass (REG-2987)

#172 PHASE C (REG-2985, measured 2026-10-29 on a scratch console of his Mac, Python 3.9, his data, no .git, 300 s): the
console still called ast.parse 4,508 times over 118 MB of source in its own heap - the swallow census 1,488 files, and
heart2.red_proofs_in 2,473 times (1,237 gate files, read once for the self-arming owed list and once more for the attack
tally, each with its own memo). RSS rose in spikes to 550-1,028 MB; macOS hands that back within seconds, and the ALT's
console (Python 3.12, 7.9 GB) holds 1,118 MB working set / 1,565 MB private. With those two answered from a separate
process instead: 540 parses (33 MB), max RSS 376 MB. Both are kept per file and keyed on the file's own stamp
(mtime_ns, size); a stale entry is never served, and a file the child could not read is not kept (it is asked again).

The child writes the SAME cache the console reads, keyed on the same source stamps, then exits - and its memory with it.

#172 REG-2987 (measured 2026-10-29, REG-2985's spike profile on a scratch console): with the parses gone, every RSS spike
past 450 MB sat inside the eagle's in-process console_doctor.run - corroborate's readings, the eye audit, the run census,
the evidence tiers, health_engine.report. The console now asks that pass of a child (doctor_rows) and asks only
console_doctor.IN_PROCESS itself. It is NOT fail-open: the rows are a verdict, so a child that fails, times out or
answers for another ask leaves the pass UNKNOWN until the eagle's next tick - never derived in the console, never an
older pass's rows. One pass at a time; the result file carries the nonce of the ask that made it.

⚠ ONLY A CONSOLE SPAWNS (frame_ref.on_console_path(), set by control_app.main()). Every law, the gate, CI and a CLI run
derive in their own process exactly as before: a law may monkeypatch a module, and a child cannot see a monkeypatch.
⚠ FAILS OPEN: a child that times out, exits non-zero or writes nothing leaves the caller to derive in-process as it
always did, and the failure is recorded here - on / worked / lastTs / say, the heart's vocabulary - never read as clean.
