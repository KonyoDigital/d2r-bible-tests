"""v3179 — A ROW THAT SAYS "NOTHING IS KNOWN" MAY NOT RENDER AS A FAULT.

HIS ORDER, 2026-09-15, reading the state panel: *"make it updated to whats needed and everythin
should be reading healthy if its not missing and those that are are being fixed ... so update the
others so they dont show those things so its honest"*.

MEASURED, and he was right: `tooltip finder` returned MISSING while its own sentence read "the
finder has never been asked — no frame has been put through it, so nothing is known about it
either way". A lane nobody has exercised is not a broken lane. Worse, MISSING feeds WHAT NEEDS
YOU, so an unexercised lane was inflating the one number he acts on.

★ THIS IS THE CONSOLE'S OLDEST DOCTRINE, ENFORCED MECHANICALLY INSTEAD OF BY MEMORY:
    0     = measured, and it is zero
    None  = nobody looked
  Collapsing them is a lie with no author. The console has corrected that confusion by hand
  repeatedly — UNIQUES SYNCED over 0/403, the both-need column refusing rather than claiming 0,
  a dead fetch made to say UNKNOWN rather than paint parity, and v3177's decoded-empty mask.
  Each was found by a person noticing. This one is found by the file.

⚠ PARSED, NEVER GREPPED. A grep would fire on the word "unknown" inside a comment, or miss a
sentence split across concatenated string parts. This walks the AST for `return MISSING, <str>`
and joins the pieces the way Python does. [[source-reading-guard]] [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
