"""A BANKED PROPOSAL SAYS SO ON THE BUTTON — #226 §1a.

THE AUDIT (issue #226, 2026-09-15): *"Vault panel stale register (#218 panel-half · STILL-REAL).
Heart/doctor/witness WIRED. `_vaultPaint` still uses stored `owned.length` for OWNED header and
`register N ✓` — no display re-grade."*

WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG, measured on the shipped file: the age WAS painted — into `_vAge`, a
caption a few lines above, correctly including "restored from disk, not from this session". The
COUNT sat on the button. So the console told the truth in one element and offered an action in
another, and the one he clicks was the one that said nothing.

A vault proposal is a SNAPSHOT: graded against the witness rules and the ledger as they stood
when that sweep ran. Re-grading it in the panel would put a second copy of the witness logic in
JS — the drift this repo refuses — so the fix is not to recompute the number but to stop
presenting a banked one as fresh. [[copy-drift]] [[stale-reading]]

⚠ `resultFromDisk` IS THE STRONGER SIGNAL, NOT THE CLOCK. A proposal restored from disk was never
made in this session at all: it can read four minutes old and still describe a sweep from a
process that no longer exists.
