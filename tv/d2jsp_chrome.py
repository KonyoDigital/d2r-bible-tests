"""Post one priced draft to d2jsp board 268 (271 on a ladder console) through the Chrome login on this machine.

The desk in bible.html calls POST /api/d2jsp_send. This module reads the d2jsp
cookies from the local Chrome profile at that moment, opens the board's own New
Trade form in a scratch Chrome, and submits only when that form is the one this
desk knows and the browser is logged in. The cookie is not stored, not logged,
and not returned, and the cookie database is read in memory, never copied to
disk. A missing login, an unreadable cookie, or a form this desk does not know
returns a status word and does not claim a post.

One send runs at a time. A submit that was clicked and not receipted is
maybe-sent, never "nothing was posted", and the same draft is not sent again
for 30 minutes after it was posted or may have been, unless a later send
changed that topic. Every answer's reason is one of SEND_REASONS.

Windows has no reader here. A public page has no route. Those stay unposted.
Linux reads the Chrome profile on that machine.
