"""v3774 (REG-2295) — WHAT A VERSION STAMP MAY CARRY, AND WHAT IT MAY NOT.

The build name and note land in bible.html (twice), WINDOWS_SHIP.json and TASKS.md of a PUBLIC repo.
bump_version.py refuses a leaking name or note before writing, and gate_ledger.py runs the same check
on every ADDED stamp line before it lets a coherent bump carry the content gates, so a note pasted by
hand past the tool still reruns them. Both callers also ask free_text_problem, which admits only
inert words. One definition, two callers.

# THE NAME AND NOTE ARE PUBLISHED FREE TEXT. They land in bible.html (twice),
# WINDOWS_SHIP.json and TASKS.md of a PUBLIC repo, and gate memory skips content gates over a coherent
# bump. leak_problem refuses home paths (every spelling), IPv4/IPv6, private hostnames, tokens and this
# machine's identity; free_text_problem refuses anything but inert words.
# The home-path ratchet's own pattern (test_no_new_home_path_is_published.HOME), pinned equal by the guard
# test. A production module may not import a test module, so it is copied. The gate's pattern stays as it
# is: it is a RATCHET over 113+ existing literals, and widening it raises the count in 20 tracked files
# (measured), which only a human baseline rewrite may accept. The leak check below is WIDER: it is
# applied to new free text only, so it can be strict without touching history.
