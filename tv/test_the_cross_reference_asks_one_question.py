"""HIS CROSS-REFERENCE READ 160/398 BESIDE A BOARD THAT SAYS 292/403 — TWO WRONG HALVES.

Konyo: *"the crossreference ... isnt really synced to the uniques"*, and later, flatly:
*"which one is it really?!!? is it 398 or 403 make a unifed logic"*.

BOTH HALVES WERE WRONG, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.

=== THE NUMERATOR — a store that answers a different question ===
`fleet_mask.LEDGERS["uniques"]["store"]` was `d2r_owned` — the VAULT store — while
control_app.py:1997 repointed the uniques TALLY to the chronicle pair at v2717 and renamed the old
measure `vaultUniques`. Nothing updated the spec. So the panel answered "what is in his vault"
under a label meaning "what his Chronicle records". SETS was immune because both its sides read
`d2r_setPieces`, which is exactly why one tab was right and the other wrong.

⚠ AND IT IS A UNION, NOT ONE STORE. `bible.html:42994`'s `_ownedNames()` IS the definition of
"found" on his board: `d2r_owned` together with `keys(d2r_foundLog)`, commented "found = ledger +
LEGACY owned". Pointing at `d2r_foundLog` alone would be correct only IF the two happened to be
nested today — a coincidence, not a definition, and the legacy store is precisely where a
long-running grail keeps its oldest finds.

=== THE DENOMINATOR — a number the page itself says means nothing ===
The panel rendered `rosterN` = `len(roster)` = 398. bible.html:3755 had already ruled:
    403  chronTotal — HIS PINNED RULING, the game's own Chronicle count
    392  funiScan().total — the carded roster after his v2680 one-tally-per-sunder ruling
    398  "produced by neither, and NO array on the page is this size"
⚠⚠ BUT `rosterN` CANNOT SIMPLY BECOME 403. `fleet_mask.decode()` REFUSES any mask whose `n` does
not equal `len(roster)` — that equality is what proves both machines packed the same roster into
the same bit positions. Changing it would make every mask on the fleet undecodable. So 403 gets
its OWN field and `rosterN` keeps its job.

=== ⚠⚠ AND THE FIX HAD A LANDMINE AIMED AT ITSELF ===
`corroborate`'s count-and-mask invariant held a SECOND, hardcoded copy of the ledger->store map
with "uniques" simply absent — so the exclusion was accidental rather than stated. Its LEFT side is
dynamic and would start counting uniques the moment this fix shipped; its RIGHT side, frozen in a
literal, would not. The invariant would have gone RED because the code got MORE correct. It now
asks `ledger_authority.surface_pairs()` — one authority, no second copy. [[copy-drift]]

⚠ Fixing that, I referenced `la` in the right closure where it is imported only in the left, and my
own `except Exception: return None` SWALLOWED the NameError — right went 1 -> None while left went
1 -> 2. Caught by watching the numbers, not by anything failing. Same shape as the `qs` defect in
/api/river the same day.

# ══ THE EXECUTABLE RED-PROOF ═════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PROPOSED by tv/heart2_candidates.py — derived from this gate's OWN assertions and
# measured against the target file (each anchor occurs exactly once). Review it: the
# question is whether deleting this text is the defect the law exists to catch.
