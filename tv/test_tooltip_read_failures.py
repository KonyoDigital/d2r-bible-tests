"""The tooltip backend keeps a READ FAILURE apart from a measured miss (v3730 / REG-2218 follow-ups).

Three cross-family findings on v3730, each a way the "unknown vs measured" line the tooltip lane is
built on could be crossed in silence:

  (1) A corrupt / locked / unreadable JPEG is a READ FAILURE, not "looked, and no tooltip here".
      density() used to RETURN (None, why) when the frame could not be opened, which locate() passed
      up and _kai_tooltip_place cached as ('measured', None) -- a miss nobody measured. It now RAISES
      LocateFailed, the one signal both callers already treat as unknown, so the kai row records
      tooltip_loc_unknown and files no panel. A MISSING frame and a frame with NO TEXT stay the
      graceful refusals they already were, so measured misses are not turned into unknowns.

  (2) The source frame handle is released. Image.open(...).convert('RGB') never closed the JPEG, so a
      re-sweep on Windows could hit a sharing-violation on the same file. A context manager closes it
      before the tile loop runs.

  (3) The per-frame locate cache keys on (path, reader), not the path alone. Two kai rows can share a
      frame and carry different tooltipReaders; the old key served one reader's rect to the other --
      a fake hit or a skipped real read.
