"""RIVER WATCHDOG — a sweep whose guard a HANG left set is cleared, on BOTH lanes, and the vault reel quarantined.

THE BUG (live 2026-10-17 on his console: vaultAutoread owed=14, lastTick {kind:busy, why:"a vault sweep is
already running"}): _vault_sweep_run / _chron_sweep_run release job["running"] only when the synchronous read
RETURNS or RAISES — their `finally` does NOT clear it (REG-1745, it only releases the sweep lock, a no-op while
running=True). A sweep that HANGS in its measure phase (a frame that never settles, a hung tooltip locate, a
read that never returns) leaves running=True forever, so every 45s/20s tick refuses "a sweep is already running"
and the river stalls on EVERY PC (Mac, GrokBot, ALT). Relaunch clears it but it RECURS.

v3758 shipped the VAULT watchdog. v3759 (this law) generalises it to ONE `_sweep_hang_check` logic shared by the
vault AND chronicle lanes, and hardens it against the v3758 cross-family (Grok) review:
  · a sweep that makes NO forward progress past _VAULT_SWEEP_HANG_DEADLINE_S is cleared (running False,
    phase 'hung'); the vault lane also quarantines its reel in _VAULT_SWEEP_QUARANTINE so the lane reads the rest.
  · a sweep that is making progress is LEFT RUNNING (any change to the progress snapshot resets the clock).
  · a sweep that is not running is a no-op.
  · FINDING 1 (TOCTOU): the snapshot is read outside the lock, so the clear re-check must prove it is the SAME
    sweep (startedTs == the snapshot's), not merely that *a* sweep is running — else a fresh, healthy sweep that
    took the slot in the gap is wrongly declared hung and its reel quarantined.
  · FINDING 3: a quarantined reel is refused at the vault_sweep_start DOOR (every caller), not only at the
    autoreel picker — a relaunch / manual / busy-retry / api caller would otherwise re-run it and re-hang.
Two RED_PROOFs below: a missing `running=False` (the stall this exists to end) and a missing startedTs identity
check (finding 1). [[heart-first]] [[the-unjoined-end]] [[unknown-stays-unknown]] [[copy-drift]]
