"""THE STAMP — a reel's JOURNEY, written down, one row per station it actually reached.

His ask, 2026-09-06: *"this maybe is a good design for a STAMPING PROCESS for each reel ive said
this before.. a visual and backend stamp even for each so they go through story line and synced
from station and down to tombstone eventually"*.

⚠⚠ WHAT WAS MISSING, MEASURED. `reel_router.route()` answers WHERE EVERY REEL IS, correctly, on
every call — and remembers nothing. Run it twice and the second answer cannot tell you whether a
reel moved between the two, because there was no first answer to compare against. So a reel has a
POSITION and has never had a JOURNEY: nothing in this tree can say "this reel reached STATION on
the 4th and PRINTER on the 6th". His sentence is about the journey — *"synced from station and
down to tombstone"* — and the journey is what did not exist.

    reel_router   WHERE IS IT NOW      recomputed every call, stored nowhere
    river_walk    WHO WOULD MOVE IT    the gate -> lane map, read-only, stores nothing
    river_stamp   WHERE HAS IT BEEN    THIS FILE. the only one that remembers.

=== THE THREE RULES THIS STORE IS BUILT ON, AND WHY EACH IS NOT NEGOTIABLE ===

1. **APPEND-ONLY MEANS NO SECOND MODE, NOT "MOSTLY APPEND".** The sibling free-space series appends
   and then trims by age — correct there, because an old free-space reading is genuinely worthless.
   It would be catastrophic here: trimming the oldest rows deletes the BEGINNING of every reel's
   journey, which is the half a journey is for. So this file opens the store `"a"` and never `"w"`,
   there is no trim, and the ceiling REFUSES a write rather than making room by forgetting.
   A store that can drop its own earliest evidence is a cache wearing a ledger's name.

2. **A STAMP RECORDS A TRANSITION, SO IT MUST NAME WHAT MOVED THE REEL.** `by` is required and an
   empty one is refused, exactly as the lane heartbeat refuses an unnamed lane. A row saying "this
   reel reached PRINTER" with nobody attached cannot answer the only question anyone will ask of
   it later, which is *who did that, and can it do it again*. `river_walk.LANE_OF_STATION` names
   the automatic lanes; `by` is not restricted to them, because a person at the console and a CLI
   run are also real causes and pretending otherwise would push them into a lane's name.

3. **NOTHING MOVED IS NOT AN EVENT.** Re-stamping a reel at the station it is already at writes
   NOTHING and says so (`wrote: False`, `ok: True`). The river is walked on a timer; a store that
   wrote a row per walk would hold ten thousand rows saying "still at CAPTURE" and the journey
   would be unreadable inside its own noise.
   ⚠ A GENUINE RE-ENTRY IS A DIFFERENT FACT AND IS KEPT. A reel that goes PRINTER -> TRIAGE ->
   PRINTER gets a SECOND PRINTER row, because it arrived there twice and that is what happened.
   The dedupe is on the reel's CURRENT station, never on "(reel, station) has been seen before" —
   the second reading would silently erase every regression, and a regression is the single most
   interesting thing a journey can contain. `reel_router.OWES["EMPTY"]` already says the EMPTY
   verdict is REOPENABLE, so re-entry is a state this river is documented to produce.

=== UNKNOWN IS A POSITION AND IT GETS STAMPED ===
`reel_router` returns `UNKNOWN` for a reel whose evidence could not be read, and is emphatic that
this is never folded into a working total. Same here: UNKNOWN is stampable — "we walked the river
on the 6th and could not place this reel" is a real, dated finding — and `census()` reports it
BESIDE the counts, never inside them. A store that refused to stamp UNKNOWN would leave those reels
with a journey that skips the days nobody could see them, which reads as continuity that did not
happen. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

=== WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, SAID HERE RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER ===
⛔ IT ARMS NOTHING, READS NO FOOTAGE, SPENDS NO MONEY AND DELETES NOTHING. It records where the
router already said a reel was. It cannot move a reel; `river_walk.CANNOT` explains why nothing in
this family can (all five lane ticks take no argument and each picks its own reel).
⛔ `run()` CANNOT STAMP TOMBSTONE, because it walks the SHELF and a deleted reel is by definition off
it. ⚠⚠ REG-1615 — AND THE WRITER THIS PARAGRAPH ONCE PROMISED NEVER EXISTED. It said "the only
writer of a tombstone row runs INSIDE the deleter"; no deleter ever stamped this store (the w26 audit:
0 TOMBSTONE rows against 47 ROUTED on his Mac), so every reel the retention pass closed out or the
disk floor reaped stayed "on the river" here for ever, and the fleet counted them as stuck (REG-1614).
`close_out()` joins that end: a reel whose folder is gone AND a deleter's OWN record names (closure
ledger, reap log) is stamped TOMBSTONE once, as an observer; one gone with no record is left for the
heart's corroborator (`river-log-matches-the-shelf`) to name. Deleting stays the deleters' alone.

    forgets; this is what makes the answer durable. It is FREE — it reads no footage, calls no
    model, and moves no reel. It records where the router already said each reel was.

    ⚠ `by` IS REQUIRED AND HAS NO DEFAULT. A default would put the same word on a timer's walk and
    a person's, and then the store could not answer which of them was moving the river.

    ⚠ `rep` IS ACCEPTED SO A HARNESS CAN HAND IN A ROUTE REPORT and never touch his shelf. When it
    is None the live router is walked. It is NOT a hist/shelf argument: `reel_router._evidence`
    refuses a mismatched shelf precisely because a fixture's clocks joined to the live shelf's
    evidence would grade his 40 real reels and pass.

    ⚠⚠ EVERY ROW THIS WRITES IS `byKind: "observer"`, WITHOUT AN OPTION TO SAY OTHERWISE. A walk
    compares the router's answer to the store and finds a reel somewhere new; it did not move it
    and cannot know what did. Letting a caller pass `observed=False` here would let the walker's
    name become a causal claim in a record that can never be corrected. A LANE that actually acted
    calls `stamp()` directly, one reel, and that row is the `actor` one.
