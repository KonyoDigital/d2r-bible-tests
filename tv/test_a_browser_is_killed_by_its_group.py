"""v3380 — A BROWSER IS KILLED BY ITS GROUP, OR IT IS NOT KILLED AT ALL.

THE INCIDENT THIS PINS. Five consecutive pushes were refused between 2026-09-19 23:00 and
2026-09-20 02:00. Every one of them passed all six static checks, including "every changed law
demonstrated it can still go red", and then died with:

    pre-push: test_control DID NOT FINISH in 1500s - load average 9.43. Push blocked.

The load averages were 9.44, 16.50 and 9.43. Two of the three were a QUIET machine, so the
"he is gaming" explanation was wrong and so was every bound theory built on it.

WHAT IT ACTUALLY WAS, measured rather than inferred. Two faulthandler dumps taken 120s apart named
the identical frame:

    File "tv/js_syntax_gate.py", line 357 in check
      -> subprocess.run -> communicate -> selectors.select
    File "tv/test_control.py", line 4544 in test_surfaces_parse_in_a_real_js_engine

subprocess.run(..., timeout=T) does NOT bound a browser. Its timeout path kills the LAUNCHER and
then calls communicate() a second time to drain the pipes. Chrome forks renderer/GPU/zygote
helpers that INHERIT the stdout pipe, and at least one of them reparents to launchd - measured on
this Mac as a live pid with PPID 1 while its launcher was already gone. The write end therefore
never closes, so that second communicate() blocks forever. The call is bounded on paper and
unbounded in fact.

The signature was identical four times: the gate halted at 244,189-244,190 bytes of output, and a
standalone run halted at 244,935 - the same place within 750 bytes, at 0.0% CPU.

THE BOUND WAS INNOCENT AND MUST NOT BE RAISED. Six completed runs on this exact tree measure
507.5 / 514.2 / 518.5 / 527.3 / 533.4 / 563.7 seconds against a 1500s ceiling - 2.66x margin.
Raising it would have hidden a real hang behind a bigger number.
(A separate true finding, recorded where it will be seen: hooks/pre-push's own comment claims
"the suite has never exceeded 720s", and its own kept logs contain a 773.229s run. That comment is
false and is not load-bearing for this fix.)

THE CURE ALREADY EXISTED AND WAS NEVER JOINED. tv/test_control.py:129 `_reap()` was written at
v1925 for precisely this failure, and says so in its own docstring:

    "The launcher is started in its own session, so ONE killpg reaches the renderer grandchildren
     that hold the stdout pipe open"

js_syntax_gate.py referenced `_reap` ZERO times and used bare subprocess.run instead. The knowledge
lived in one file and was absent in the neighbour that needed it - [[the-unjoined-end]].

WHAT THIS FILE PINS - behaviour first, text only where behaviour cannot reach:
  * a launcher that outlives its timeout is killed BY GROUP, so a pipe-holding grandchild dies too
  * TimeoutExpired still propagates, so v1808's "a timeout is not a syntax verdict" node fallback
    is untouched and "nobody could check" never reads as "it is broken"
  * the browser is started in its own session, which is what makes one killpg sufficient
  * check() does not reach for subprocess.run on a browser argv again
