"""v3369 (#60) — A FACT THE READER SAW MUST REACH THE ROW, AND TWO PROJECTIONS WERE EATING IT.

v3368 taught the prompt to ask for sockets/ethereal/quality and `normalize_item` to parse them.
It shipped, and the facts still never reached his store, because the chain is SIX links and only
the first two were built:

    1. the prompt asks                        v3368  built
    2. normalize_item parses                  v3368  built
    3. `sight`        item     -> evidence    v3368  DROPPED ALL FOUR
    4. _witness_rows  evidence -> banked      v3368  DROPPED ALL FOUR
    5. the owned / unsure row                 v3368  DROPPED ALL FOUR
    6. vault_seen.json                        never received them

MEASURED the day after v3368 shipped: 44 banked rows, 0 carrying sockets/eth/quality. The cross-
family eye said the same thing from the other side, unprompted — "the only consumer of the three
new fields is the new doctor check; its producer lives in the missing files." It had been shown
the READER and never the WRITER.

=== THIS PROJECTION HAS EATEN A FIELD FOUR TIMES NOW ===
_witness_rows rebuilds each row by NAMING the fields it keeps, and its own comments record the
history: conf (v1786), the witness id (v2209), the crop (v2239) — each found late, each repaired
by hand, each invisible until something downstream read a confident blank. v3368's four make it
the fourth.

The cure already existed ONE BOUNDARY LOWER. v2074 hit the identical shape at apply_payload after
FOUR silent drops (v1986, v1996, v2004, v2006) and closed it with APPLY_NOT_SHIPPED: a declared
list, so an omission is deliberate or it is a test failure. Nobody carried that discipline up to
the projection above it. WITNESS_NOT_CARRIED does that here, and the last case below is what makes
a FIFTH drop loud instead of silent. [[the-unjoined-end]] [[heart-first]] §6

=== WHY THE ROW CARRIES A SET AND NOT A VALUE ===
A stash holds TWO `Gorgon Crossbow` — one ethereal 4-socket, one plain. They are different items
worth different money and they fold to the SAME (name, lane) key. Measured on his live store: 4
of 44 rows already carry more than one witness (Horadric Cube 20, War Traveler 4, Magefist 2,
Gheed's Fortune 2).

So a row-level `sockets` would be a one-to-many fact in a one-to-one store — setdefault keeps the
first, d[k] = v keeps the last, and neither says a word about the other. The SIGHTING carries what
one look saw; the ROW carries the distinct variants it has seen. [[one-to-one-store-for-a-one-to-
many-fact]]

=== ZERO AND FALSE ARE ANSWERS ===
    sockets 0     the reader saw it has none       sockets null  it could not tell
    eth     False visibly not ethereal             eth     null  unknown
The carry loop tests `is not None`, never truthiness. `if e.get("eth")` would throw away every
"definitely not ethereal" reading as though nobody had looked, on a field that decides what gets
thrown out. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
