"""The Chronicle's own denominator, re-derived from the game files 2026-09-03.

⚠ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE THE ANSWER WAS LOST ONCE ALREADY. `bible.html` has carried this note for
months: *"One of the two is wrong by one entry, and neither can be re-derived on this machine right
now: the CASC extractor lives at /tmp/casc_extract and /tmp does not survive a reboot."* The
extractor SOURCE survived (it is `tv/casc_extract.c`, in this repo), and his 28 GB store survived.
The only thing that did not survive was the OUTPUT — the one thing anyone needed. So this file
records the measurement and the recipe, and no one has to rebuild CascLib to answer a question that
has now been answered twice.

⚠ THE GAME FILE ITSELF IS NOT COMMITTED. This repo is PUBLIC and `uniqueitems.txt` is Blizzard's
data. What is here is the arithmetic and how to reproduce it.

MEASURED, from `data:data/global/excel/uniqueitems.txt` pulled out of the live RotW CASC store:

      439  data rows in uniqueitems.txt
     -24   disableChronicle = 1   (Azurewrath, Constricting Ring, Gore Ripper,
                                   Zakarum's Salvation, Odium, ...)
     ----
      415  <- exactly what diablo2.io lists, and what a Google AI Overview echoed at him
     -12   further rows that are not spawnable
     ----
      403  spawnable AND in the Chronicle    <- THE GAME'S OWN CHRONICLE
      396  DISTINCT names among those 403
           Rainbow Facet occupies 8 rows, one per element -> 7 duplicate rows

So `chronTotal = 403` in bible.html is CORRECT and matches the game file exactly, and the in-game
panel reading of **404** recorded in that same comment was a misread. 415 is not wrong either — it
is 439 minus the 24 the game explicitly excludes from the Chronicle, which is a different question.

⚠ AN OPEN MEASUREMENT, NOT A DEFECT: the game has 396 DISTINCT Chronicle names while
`unique_roster.json` carries 398. Those count different things — the roster is built from the
page's own `_gUniqueRoster()`, which includes `_UNI_EXTRA` — and neither is claimed wrong here.
Anyone looking at that gap should start from the 8 Rainbow Facet rows.

HOW TO REPRODUCE (about ten minutes, needs the game installed):

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ladislav-zezula/CascLib.git
    cd CascLib && mkdir build && cd build
    # current cmake refuses the project's own minimum without this
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 .. && make -j4
    # -Wl,-rpath or the binary cannot find its own framework at runtime
    g++ -O2 -std=c++17 -I<CascLib>/src -x c++ tv/casc_extract.c \\
        -F<CascLib>/build -framework casc -Wl,-rpath,<CascLib>/build -o casc_extract
    ./casc_extract "<D2R install>/Data" \\
        "data:data/global/excel/uniqueitems.txt" uniqueitems.txt
    python3 tv/chronicle_total.py --count uniqueitems.txt
