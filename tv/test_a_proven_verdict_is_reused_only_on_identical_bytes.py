"""#42 P3 — A PUSH REUSES A PROVEN VERDICT ONLY WHEN EVERY BYTE IT DEPENDS ON IS IDENTICAL; EVERYTHING ELSE RUNS.

His order, 2026-09-28: "this is CRITICAL we need to optimize clock time". MEASURED 2026-09-29 on the v3523 push: the
render gate refused at minute 95 (twice), and every retry re-proved the same ~40 changed laws (~83 min) over a tree that
had not changed by one byte - three times. A verdict cache would have made each retry render-and-publish only (~15 min).

`heart2.py --prove NAMES --push` (hooks/pre-push's call) now banks each PROVEN under a key that digests EVERY file the
proof can depend on - the law file, the tv/ modules it imports transitively (browser_gates' AST closure), every file a
literal string in that closure names (bible.html, control_ui.html, hooks/pre-push ...), the proof's tampered target
(#41 rank 8: PROVEN was keyed to the gate file alone, so an edit to the SUBJECT could make a proof BLIND while the census
read proven), every PROOF_NEEDS file, the proof entry, the gate's spec and the prover itself - and the next push re-runs
only the proofs whose key changed. A miss runs. An unkeyable law (a helper nobody can parse, a PROOF_NEEDS directory)
runs every push and is never cached. Only PROVEN is stored and only a stored PROVEN is reused. The key is taken from the
SANDBOX (the exact tree proved), before and after the run - a tree that moved under a proof banks nothing. The plain
--prove path, run_gates and CI never open it: the verdict of record is always a run.

THE SECOND EYE ON THE FIRST CUT (2026-09-29) added four rules, each pinned below: a REUSED proof keeps the time it was
MEASURED - the census stamps a gate standing on cached proofs with the oldest provedAt among them, never this run's
clock (the first cut stamped every hit "now", the defect control_app's oldestProofMs was built against); a law that
LISTS A DIRECTORY ITSELF (os.listdir / os.walk / glob / Path.iterdir) has an input no byte key can name and is never
cached - the law file only, never the closure; the cache's OWN failure (key_for raising) costs a re-prove and never a
verdict; and a stored PROVEN with no readable provedAt is not reused, because a verdict nobody can date cannot keep its
age.

R4 (REG-2341, 2026-10-21) - the v1 file reached 320 MB because every entry kept its whole inputs list and the cap ran
before the merge with the disk, which undid it. An entry now keeps nInputs and a digest of the names; the cap runs AFTER
the merge and evicts the least useful first (an entry no reader could serve, then one superseded by a newer proof of
the same gate/proof/target/widths, then one whose gate is gone, then the least recently USED or proved); and an entry
that stands on facts - a traced kind, a facts reference - is never served by this byte key (the critic: missing or
unreadable facts are a MISS, always). The store lives in git's common dir (REG-2340), gitignored side files and all.

EVERYTHING HERE IS A FIXTURE: a throwaway repo copy holding a ten-line law, its helper, its subject and a bible.html; the
cache file lives beside them. No browser starts, the real tree is never copied, nothing of his is read or written -
except the cases that READ the real registry, .gitignore and the CI workflows, because that is where the wiring lives.
