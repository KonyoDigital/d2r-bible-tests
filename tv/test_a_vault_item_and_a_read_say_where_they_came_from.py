"""THE HEART ROWS FOR THE OWNED DOOR: 'a vault item with no provenance' and 'a read left no picture'.

His words, 2026-09-28: "make sure its all connected correctly and wired to the heart of the console", and "where is
the ledger proof of these two items? i cant find it.. how can i see the evidence and picture pixels".

heart-first: a door that writes provenance is not finished until something shouts when a vault item has none, and
the recorder's floor rules are not finished until something shouts when a read that named an item left no picture —
naming who took it, or that it was never written. Both are UNKNOWN (never 0, never OK) when what they judge could
not be read. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

WHAT THIS LAW HOLDS (pure verdicts driven with fixtures — game item names only, never his store; the board is read
through the doctor's ONE shared board read, stubbed here; the shelf is a temp directory):
  · owned_provenance_verdict — MISSING names every owned name with no row that says who filed it; a receipt and a
    filing witness both count; UNKNOWN when either store is unreadable; an empty vault is OK with its 0 said.
  · vault_provenance_verdict — a filing whose only row is an owned RECEIPT is still an unwitnessed filing.
  · read_pictures.verdict / _check_a_read_left_no_picture — a read with names whose frame is on disk is fine; one
    whose frame is gone names the recorder's reap record, or says "never written" from the refusal record, or says
    UNKNOWN; reads older than 24 h and reads with no names are not judged; an unreadable journal or shelf is UNKNOWN.
  · read_pictures.status_for — the console's /api/picture_status answer, per frame: present, or gone with the reason.
  · M5 (review of 77d8d8b5) — a reel-relative ref whose file is still loose at the top level is ON DISK: the locator
    probes the bare stem after the exact miss, top level then every reel, as frame_ref.Index.resolve does.
  · both rows are in CHECKS, WATCHES and corroborate's registry; the route is served.
