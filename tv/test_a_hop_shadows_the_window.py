"""A HOP INTO THE BOARD FRAME MUST SHADOW `window`, NEVER ASSIGN IT.

v3209 joined the WRITE door to the board by hopping the JS context into the `#tvd-eng` iframe. It
did it with `window = _cw;`. **`window` is not an assignable binding** — in sloppy mode that write
is discarded with no error at all. So the hop "succeeded", changed nothing, and every line after it
went on asking the console shell.

MEASURED 2026-09-16: his console was running v3211, which CONTAINS v3209, and
`/api/chronicle_apply` still answered *"this page has no LSR, so a handoff note could not be
written into the right world"* — the exact refusal v3209 existed to end. Three restore attempts
were spent before the cause was found, while his ledger sat visibly wrong on screen.

⚠⚠ THE READ DOOR NEVER MADE THIS MISTAKE, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE FIX. `board_ownership`
keeps a LOCAL `_ctx` and passes it as a PARAMETER NAMED `window` into an inner function, shadowing
the global for that scope. A parameter is assignable; the global is not. The two halves of one
channel were written days apart and only one of them was correct.

⚠⚠ A GATE THAT GREPPED FOR `tvd-eng` OR `_cw` WAS GREEN ACROSS THIS ENTIRE DEFECT — both strings
were present and the mechanism was dead. This pins the MECHANISM: shadow present, assignment
absent. It reads the JS by PARSING control_app.py's string literals, never by slicing a window of
source text around a guess. [[source-reading-guard]] [[the-unjoined-end]]

    v3215 joined `board_tick` to the frame hop and gated it on

    `set` tick in the wrong context and answered *"no toggleSetPiece"* about a window while the
    real one sat one frame away. Found by a cross-family look at v3215, reproduced in node before
    being believed: with a shell exposing only `toggleOwned` and a frame exposing only
    `toggleSetPiece`, a `set` tick reached the FRAME and never touched the shell.

    ⚠ AND THE MIRROR ERROR, SAME SHIP: `board_mask` is a READER, and the same pass made its hop
    demand `LSR.setItem`. A read-only LSR is a legitimate arrangement, and it would have been
    refused a read it could serve. That was a finding taken WHOLESALE instead of per-door — the
