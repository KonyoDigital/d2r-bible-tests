"""v3345 (#68) — THE BOARD FOLDS THE APOSTROPHE TOO, NOT JUST THE PYTHON STORE.

HIS RULING, 2026-09-19: *"make it one word and unified."*

v2760 fixed the PYTHON half — `chron_evidence.json` keyed the confluence store by RAW name, so one
item lived in two buckets and cross-reel corroboration could never fire. Its own docstring names the
cause and it is still true today:

    "bible.html spells these four items CURLY in the item rows and STRAIGHT in ITEM_VALUE,
     in the same file" — Atma's Scarab · Seraph's Hymn · The Cat's Eye · Saracen's Chance

THE BOARD HALF WAS NEVER FIXED. `_chMapHas` / `_chSetHas` are what decide whether a roster row reads
as FOUND, and they folded CASE and not the apostrophe:

    _chNameKeys("Atma's Scarab")  ->  ["Atma's Scarab", "atma's scarab"]
    his gameFound map key         ->  "Atma’s Scarab"
    match?                        ->  FALSE

MEASURED on his live board, POST /api/board_ownership, 2026-09-19. Of 445 dated names exactly TWO
carry the typographic byte — `Atma’s Scarab` and `Saracen’s Chance` — and BOTH his `dates`
and `gameFound` stores key them that way, consistently. So his board is not self-contradictory; the
roster spells them the ASCII way and the lookup could never reach his rows. An item he genuinely
owns read as NOT FOUND. Same defect as v2760, one surface along. [[the-unjoined-end]]

=== THE AXIS, AND IT IS NOT NEGOTIABLE ===
tv/item_identity.py already rules on this exact split and cites this exact item:

    RENDERING (must be folded — keeping it SPLITS one real thing)   the apostrophe byte
    IDENTITY  (must be kept  — folding it MERGES two real things)   Latent / Renewed

So this folds the apostrophe and MUST NOT fold a qualifier. `Latent Rotting Fissure` and
`Rotting Fissure` are two things he can hold at once.

⚠ HIS STORED BYTES ARE NOT TOUCHED. They are testimony — "manual anything is enough witness" — so
the READER is made tolerant rather than his records rewritten. [[manual-tally-is-witness]]

⚠ AND THE FOLD RUNS ON BOTH SIDES. Folding only the QUERY cannot help: the map is keyed with
whatever byte HIS store holds, so a straight-apostrophe query still misses a curly key. The map's
own keys are folded too, and only after a direct miss, so the common path is untouched.
