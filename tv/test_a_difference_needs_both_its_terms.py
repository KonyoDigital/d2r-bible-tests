"""BOTH SIDES OF A SUBTRACTION MUST BE MEASURED, OR THE DIFFERENCE IS FICTION.

`vault_autosort` counts the mule-assignment store, presses `vaultAutoAssign()`, counts again, and
reports the difference. v3224 noticed that an unreadable store yields a count of **0** and added
`okBefore` so a failed read could not masquerade as an empty vault — and applied it to exactly one
of the two identical reads. The `after` read kept `var after=0` behind an EMPTY catch.

So with his real numbers, a store that reads fine before the press and fails after:

    assignedBefore: 173      assignedAfter: 0      newlyAssigned: -173

**A large negative number that reads as mass un-assignment, and an `assignedAfter: 0` that reads
as an emptied vault — both from a read that never happened.** The comment sitting beside it named
the hazard exactly (*"`before` would read 0 if the store were unreadable"*) while guarding one
side of it. Found by a cross-family review of v3224, the version that added the half-guard.
[[zero-needs-a-denominator]] [[copy-drift]]

⚠⚠ THIS GATE EXECUTES THE FRAGMENT, AND ITS FIRST VERSION DID NOT — WHICH IS WHY IT PASSED ITS
OWN SABOTAGE. That version asserted the token `okAfter` was PRESENT. Deleting the declaration left
the token in the return expression, so the text was unchanged and the gate went green over code
that would now throw a ReferenceError. A green sabotage means the sabotage is wrong OR the gate
is — here it was the gate, in the file whose docstring warns about exactly this.
[[sabotage-is-usually-the-wrong-one]]

It now runs the real fragment in node against a stubbed board whose second read throws, and reads
the JSON that comes back.

⚠ THE FRAGMENT IS EXTRACTED, NOT RETYPED. The subject is a JS fragment held in a Python string, and
the thing being asserted is its STRUCTURE. `ast.literal_eval` gets the real fragment and
`node --check` proves it is a program — a text search would pass on the same bytes inside a
comment. [[source-reading-guard]] [[feedback-comments-vs-code]]
