"""#174 v-B4 review — THE RAIL'S FOLD IS A CHEVRON HE CAN SEE, NOT A DOT: MEASURED IN PIXELS, IN A REAL BROWSER.

The v-B4 picker drew the weapon rail as the game's type tree, each parent with a fold (open / folded). The fold was the
glyph ▴ / ▾ - the SMALL triangles - at 15px Inter: MEASURED by the review with PIL on the shipped modal at 2000x1300,
Shields' fold drew 4x3 px of ink and Axes' 4x3 (d01_weapon_select_Sorceress_2000.png); theirs, on the same rows of their
planner, 14x8 (63_botd_base_tab.png). This law's own instrument, run on the pre-fix page, read every fold at 4x4
(2000x1300, builder and mule host) and 3x4 (375x812); after the fix 14x9 and 12x8. At 1x they read as dots - the very thing the CSS comment beside them said they no
longer did. Every node law was green: the button, its aria-expanded and its glyph were all in the HTML. Only pixels see it.

This law opens the picker by REAL INPUT in its own headless Chrome and reads the PIXELS of every fold on the rail
(Page.captureScreenshot clipped to the button, once shown and once hidden - its ink is what IT draws, never a
scrollbar beside it - decoded by frozen_frames.png_rows, stdlib, no PIL):

  · THE BUILDER at 2000x1300 (the Tools tab, the Character Builder card, the right-hand slot - pressed at their centres)
    and at 375x812: every fold drawn has at least FLOOR px of ink - two thirds of their measured 14x8, and far above the
    4x3 dot - and an open fold points UP while a folded one points DOWN (the ink's top row narrower than its bottom row
    when open, wider when folded - the mean of each half of its rows), so open and folded are told apart by their shape.
  · A PRESS ON A FOLDED CHEVRON (Axes) opens its node, and its chevron now points up.
  · THE MULE HOST at 2000x1300 (the Vault tab, a mule, its right-hand slot): the same folds, the same ink.
