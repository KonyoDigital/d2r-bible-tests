"""RENDER A SHIPPED VERSION THE WAY HE ACTUALLY SEES IT, for the cold second-eye pass.

The push gate refuses to ship version N+1 until version N has been looked at by a different model
family. That look is only worth the gate protecting it if the pixels are the REAL pixels — and
mine were not. Two flaws, both measured on 2026-08-29:

  ⚠ RELATIVE ASSETS 404 WHEN YOU RENDER FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. I extracted the shipped bible.html
    with `git show` into a scratch directory and rendered it there. Every `src="art/…"` in the
    page resolves against the DOCUMENT'S directory, so the whole art corpus vanished. Measured:
    50 broken images from the scratch copy against 5 from the repo, and the second eye duly
    reported a broken image in the Vault header that does not exist on his screen. I nearly
    "fixed" a file that was never missing. The document must live at the REPO ROOT so its
    relative paths mean what they mean in production. [[feedback-suspect-the-instrument]]

  ⚠ A TAB SWITCH IS A 0.28s FADE, AND 1.6s WAS NOT ENOUGH IN PRACTICE. A capture taken too early
    handed the eye a half-painted Vault: mean luminance 12.2 against 30.0 for the same panel
    settled, and 1.5% of pixels above the dark floor against 19.2%. It reads as a styling
    regression and is a stopwatch. This waits for the panel to reach full opacity and then
    measures that it did.

  ⚠ AND IT REFUSES RATHER THAN HANDING OVER A BAD FRAME. A black capture, a panel still
    transparent, or a broken-image count above the baseline all stop the run. A cold read is
    evidence; evidence taken through a broken instrument is worse than none, because the ledger
    records it as a look that happened. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

    ⚠ v2268 — WITHOUT `region` THIS HARNESS ONLY EVER SAW THE FIRST SCREEN, and four consecutive
    cold reads were "clean" about a page whose defect sat two screens below the fold. Measured on
    the vault tab: the routing ledger's first row is at y=2114 (1440x1000) and y=2719 (901x900), on
    pages 2611 and 3208 tall. A whole column of item names was truncated to as little as THREE
    PIXELS and no read could have seen it. [[gate-blind-to-unexercised-input]]

    Four things had to be true before a frame of a deep region was worth handing to anyone, and
    each one was learned by getting a wrong picture first:

      1. THE PAGE DOES NOT SCROLL under setDeviceMetricsOverride. scrollIntoView, window.scrollTo,
         documentElement.scrollTop and body.scrollTop all leave scrollY at 0 and the rect unmoved,
         even after forcing html{overflow:auto} — the emulated viewport lays the whole document out
         at once. So this is a capture problem, not a scrolling one.
      2. MEASURE AND CAPTURE IN ONE LAYOUT. Measuring in a 1000px viewport and then capturing with
         captureBeyondViewport reflows the page and the crop lands ~2000px off. Grow the viewport
         FIRST, then measure.
      3. OPEN WHAT IS CLOSED — and a `.collapsed` class is not the only way to be closed. The
         routing ledger lives inside a <details> that ships shut, and a child of a closed <details>
         reports its FULL height from getBoundingClientRect while nothing paints. That rect is a lie
         about visibility, and it produced a crop of a heading over blank space which I then read as
         "the panel is collapsed" and nearly retracted a correct diagnosis over.
      4. REFUSE IF THE REGION IS EMPTY. A picture of a card with no rows in it, labelled with the
         card's name, is exactly the false evidence this whole lane exists to prevent — the eye read
         four item names off one and called them complete. [[feedback-suspect-the-instrument]]"""
