"""HIS FOOTAGE AND HIS JOURNAL MAY NEVER BE TRACKED. THIS REPO IS PUBLIC.

★ v3258 committed `tv/tvd-reel-seed-small.tgz` — **97.84 MB** containing `sessions.jsonl` (his
3.4 MB journal) and two `frames/hist/reel_*` directories of his actual gameplay footage — onto the
public remote. It went in through `git add -A`, which cannot tell work from whatever the tooling
happened to drop in the tree that minute.

⚠ IN THE SAME SESSION, v3256 shipped specifically to stop `reader_health` printing that journal's
absolute PATH into a public issue. Then the journal itself was committed. The narrow fix landed and
the wide hole stayed open, which is why this law is about the TREE and not about one filename.

⚠ IT WAS ALSO ~2 MB FROM BREAKING EVERY PUSH: GitHub warned at 97.84 MB against a hard limit of
100 MB, and `.git` is already 2.1 GB.

`safe_copy.py` already exists to stop this class of accident when COPYING the tree (it refuses
above 400 MB, because `tv/` holds 5.8 GB of his reels). Nothing guarded the COMMIT side.

        are ALREADY tracked under `tv/frames/hist/reel_s_*` — twelve-plus reel directories with
        real session timestamps, on a PUBLIC repo, against a live store of 800 reels / 2.3 GB.
        That predates this session; the v3258 tarball merely duplicated two of those same reels.

        ⚠ THIS LAW DOES NOT BLESS THAT. Removing 552 tracked files would break whatever CI fixture
        depends on them and is irreversible on a public remote — HIS decision, not mine. What a
        gate CAN honestly do is stop it growing, so the exposure is bounded and visible instead of
        creeping. A law that went red on arrival for a pre-existing condition would be waved
        through within a day, which is the failure `regression-guard` names.

        than guessing. If it ever falls, lower it — that is progress and this law should not
        stand in the way.
