"""v3342 (#93) — A RIDER IS WATCHED WITHOUT CLAIMING A THREAD.

`tvd-read-names-feeder` shipped in v3323 with its own lane name and its own lifetime counters, and
NOTHING has surfaced it since. His #28 ruling was explicit — the feeder gets "built AND watched in
the same version, never the watch alone" — and v3323 shipped the build and broke the watch in the
same stroke.

THE CAUSE, MEASURED, AND IT WAS NOT A MISSING FEATURE:

    _lane_stamps(control_app.py):
        strings            21   tvd-read-names-feeder PRESENT      <- the stamp was always SEEN
        tick_by_encloser   21   no encloser maps to it             <- and always DISCARDED

    ast over the live source — defs that stamp more than one lane: exactly ONE
        def _vault_autoread_loop
            line 24289   tvd-vault-autoread
            line 24311   tvd-read-names-feeder
        tick_by_encloser['_vault_autoread_loop'] = 'tvd-vault-autoread'   <- setdefault kept the first

A `{def: ONE stamp}` map cannot hold a loop that beats for two lanes, so the second was parsed at
every census and dropped on the floor. [[one-to-one-store-for-a-one-to-many-fact]]

⚠ AND A LAW WAS SHOUTING ABOUT IT THE WHOLE TIME. test_every_lane_stamps_its_own_beat asserted
`exactly one` beat per def and has been RED in CI on every run since v3323 —
`['tvd-vault-autoread (_vault_autoread_loop) stamps 2'] != []` — for EIGHTEEN versions. A
permanently-red gate stops carrying information, and this is what that costs. [[regression-guard]] §2

WHY A RIDER AND NOT A VESSEL. The census enumerates THREADS (LOOP 20 / TASK 10 / FOREIGN 2) and the
feeder has none — it runs inside vault-autoread's tick. heart.py's NOT_A_VESSEL says one-shot work
"inherits its caller's vessel" because "giving each its own would make the roster claim more runs
without you than there are", and that reasoning is sound and is NOT overruled here. But a rider is
not nothing either: it has its own name, its own counters, and its own reason to exist — v3323 kept
the names apart deliberately, because the tick it rides SPENDS money on paid sweeps while the feeder
banks names already read and costs nothing, so "one supervisor row must never answer for two lanes".

So: a third shelf. Supervised on its own row, counted in nobody's vessel total, NAMING the vessel it
rides. [[heart-first]] [[the-unjoined-end]] [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
