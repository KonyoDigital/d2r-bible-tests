"""A "both need" list may only be shown when the roster IS the universe.

His ask, 2026-09-12: a third column on the fleet cross-reference — "tell me the items we BOTH need
combined not only the items we each have that the other doesnt".

⚠⚠ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, because the feature looked like pure arithmetic and is not. The two
columns that panel already shows are DIFFERENCES — "in their mask, not in mine" — and a difference
is true whatever exists OUTSIDE the roster, because a name nobody enrolled never enters the
question. "Neither of us has it" is a COMPLEMENT, and a complement is a claim about the WHOLE
UNIVERSE. It is the first thing in this panel that a wrong denominator can falsify, and the two
beside it never were.

MEASURED on his tree the day it was built:

    sets     roster 135  ·  his board posts total 135   -> equal; the roster is the universe
    uniques  roster 398  ·  his board posts total 403   -> FIVE of his own pinned names sit outside
                                                           the roster and could never appear

So on the uniques tab an unguarded column would confidently name "everything neither of you has"
while being structurally unable to mention five of his own items. That is not a rounding error, it
is a lie with a number on it. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]] [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

⚠ EVERY LAW HERE ASSERTS A REFUSAL AS WELL AS A PASS. A guard only ever seen say yes is not a guard.

    1. `tile(n, mine)` was a BOOLEAN helper for a two-column panel, and its hover card read
       facts: [[mine ? 'you have it' : 'they have it', ...]]. A both-need item passed with
       mine=false would have stated "they have it / you do not" — a confident false claim about
       the cousin's inventory, in a tooltip, which is the one place a reader trusts completely.

    2. `|| []` on the payload. The other two lists coalesce because a missing difference really is
       an empty difference. The complement must not: the server answers null when the roster is
       not known to be the universe, and `|| []` turns that refusal into "0 items you both need".
