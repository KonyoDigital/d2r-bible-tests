"""v3354 (#106) — A VERSION STAMP IS NOT A BLIND SPOT.

v3349 gave the ledger a `partial` counter: how many looks never saw part of the change. It was the
right question and it fired on EVERYTHING. MEASURED 2026-09-19 over the 7 rows that carry `absent`:

    rows flagged partial by the shipped counter      7 of 7
    rows that missed anything but a version stamp    2 of 7     <- the honest number
    absent-file entries that were STAMP-ONLY        12 of 16

A warning that fires on every row carries no information, which is the same defect as a gate that
is always green. [[regression-guard]] [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]

=== THE TWO THAT MATTER, AND THEY ARE REAL ===
    v3349  clean     absent: tv/second_eye_run.py (21 lines), tv/test_a_partial_look_is_not_
                     agreement.py (218 lines), tv/test_a_payload_names_what_it_left_out.py (4)
    v3351  findings  absent: tv/test_the_session_gets_a_vote_on_where.py (33 lines)

v3349 was filed `clean` over a payload that never contained its own 218-line subject. That is the
exact shape v3349 itself was written about, and the counter it shipped could not point at it
because it was pointing at everything.

=== ⚠⚠ WHY A FILENAME ALLOW-LIST IS THE WRONG FIX, AND IT WAS MEASURED BEFORE BUILDING ===
Across the last 120 version commits, six files change in >=99% of them:

    100.0% tv/WINDOWS_SHIP.json   100.0% TASKS.md    100.0% tv/tv_diablo.py
    100.0% bible.html             100.0% tv/control_app.py     99.2% BLUEPRINT.md

Excusing those by NAME is obvious and wrong in both directions — bible.html and control_app.py are
the two files most often the real subject of a version. One filename, opposite verdicts:

    bible.html        @ e850b847 (v3345)  SUBSTANTIVE  37 changed lines — the apostrophe fold
    bible.html        @ c08875ad (v3352)  STAMP         2 changed lines, both version tokens
    tv/control_app.py @ d2b3f3cf (v3343)  SUBSTANTIVE   8 changed lines — the rider route
    tv/control_app.py @ c08875ad (v3352)  STAMP         2 changed lines, both version tokens

So the test asks about the CHANGE, never the name. [[the-unjoined-end]] §6.

=== THE FALSE-NEGATIVE DIRECTION WAS HUNTED BEFORE SHIPPING, NOT ASSUMED AWAY ===
A substantive change whose every line happens to carry a version token would be waved through. So
the whole population was swept — 80 version commits, every changed file. Among the file types the
classifier can actually be handed, a stamp-classified change is ALWAYS exactly two lines:

    bible.html  2/2/2 (n=71)   tv/tv_diablo.py  2/2/2 (n=80)   tv/control_app.py  2/2/2 (n=52)

The only large all-version-token diffs are TASKS.md (up to 9 lines) and tv/WINDOWS_SHIP.json (4) —
the ship-note rows, where every line names the version. Neither can ever reach this classifier:
`absent_from` asks git for *.py, *.mjs, *.sh and *.html only, so a .md or .json is outside the
question by construction. That bound is pinned below rather than trusted.

⚠ UNKNOWN IS NEVER AN EXCUSE. The classifier only ever REMOVES a warning, and may do so only where
the change was MEASURED to be a stamp. An unreadable diff stays outside the excuse.
[[unknown-stays-unknown]]

⚠ HIS 867 EXISTING ROWS ARE NOT REWRITTEN. They carry no classification, so the reader takes it
from their own sha — the same measurement from the same source, later. Testimony stands.
