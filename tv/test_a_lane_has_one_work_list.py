"""v3295 — A LANE HAS ONE WORK LIST, AND EVERY INSTRUMENT READS THAT ONE.

The vault lane's work list is `OWED_BY ∩ READ_CLEARS`. That expression was written out by hand in
THREE separate places, and the copies drifted:

  · control_app._vault_autoread_candidates  — correct since v2878
  · control_app's "awaiting a sweep" count  — correct, with its own UNKNOWN policy
  · river_walk's PRINTER probe              — STALE: counted the single tag `vault-owes`

So the river printed *"the lane's queue is EMPTY: ... this reel waits for a seal nothing will
write"* while the lane was in fact holding 3 `panels-never-banked` reels. An instrument and the
thing it measures disagreeing about what the lane is FOR — and the instrument was the one being
believed, because it is the one that renders.

⚠ THE THIRD COPY WAS FOUND BY THE GREP THAT WROTE THIS LAW, NOT BY THE INVESTIGATION. Two copies
were known when the fix started; the sweep for "is anyone else recomputing this" turned up a third.
That is the argument for the STRUCTURAL half below: a law that only checked the two known callers
would have shipped green over the third. [[copy-drift]] [[the-unjoined-end]]

TWO HALVES, and they fail for different reasons on purpose:

  1. STRUCTURAL — no production module iterates `OWED_BY.items()` at all. The single definition is
     `shelf_driver.lane_read_tags(lane)`. This is deliberately stricter than "don't duplicate the
     intersection": ANY hand-rolled walk of that map is a future copy waiting to drift, and the
     cheap way to keep one definition is to make the map's iteration itself off-limits outside its
     own module.

  2. BEHAVIOURAL — the set actually contains the tag whose absence caused this. Asserting the
     structure alone would go green over a `lane_read_tags` that returned the wrong set, which is
     the same defect one layer down. [[presence-law-vs-reachability-law]]

⚠ THIS LAW STRIPS COMMENTS BEFORE READING (frame_authority._executable_only). Load-bearing: the
modules under test carry comments that spell out `OWED_BY ∩ READ_CLEARS` in prose to explain the
rule, and a law reading raw source would fail on its own documentation. That is REG-1070.

⚠ TEST FILES ARE EXEMPT BY DESIGN. A law that pinned `lane_read_tags` by CALLING it would be
circular — it would agree with whatever the function returned. The laws that check this set
recompute it independently on purpose, and that is the only correct way for them to disagree.
