"""EVERY PROBE MUST BE ABLE TO SAY UNKNOWN, AND MUST SAY IT WHEN HANDED NOTHING.

⚠⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS A PATTERN NOT AN INCIDENT. Four times on 2026-09-04 a fix shipped
the very class of defect it was fixing, one edit away:

    REG-534  two store filenames retyped instead of quoted
    REG-537  a snapshot frozen at import — written ONE LINE BELOW the fix for REG-534
    REG-540  a store path resolved two ways, in the module built to catch dead fields
    REG-541  a wholly unreadable store reporting OK — shipped INSIDE the fix for REG-540's crash,
             by the one module whose entire job is refusing to call the unmeasured clean

The rule was quoted correctly in every one of those commits. What failed was never the rule; it was
that **the NEW code was not re-asked the question the rule exists to ask.** A note cannot fix that.
A law can: every probe on this list is handed nothing, and must answer UNKNOWN rather than a
verdict. It runs against ALL of them, so the next probe added inherits the question automatically.

⚠ IT IS A LAW, NOT A ROSTER. It asserts the BEHAVIOUR (nothing in -> UNKNOWN out) rather than
pinning today's module list to a number, so adding a probe cannot make it stale — but an
ENTRY that stops existing is a refusal, because a probe silently dropped from this list is exactly
how the law stops covering the thing it was written for. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

    GitHub runner BOTH are absent, every store is UNKNOWN, and the stub's incompleteness cannot

    ⚠ AND `one_funnel.HERE`, found by MEASURING rather than reading: with `open` instrumented,

    opening the real `tv/retro_triage.json` and `tv/vault_swept.json` from inside the corpus —
    `one_funnel.py:128` joins its store name onto `HERE` at call time. It reads those for rung
    COVERAGE and not for its verdict, so nothing was ever red, which is exactly why it would have
    kept leaking.

    ⚠⚠ AND THE HOOK LIST IS STILL NOT COMPLETE — SAID HERE BECAUSE AN UNSTATED GAP BECOMES A
    FALSE CLAIM OF CONTAINMENT. Measured on HIS MAC 2026-09-05, after the two hooks above:

    The path, from a captured stack rather than a guess: `reel_story.story` -> the `RR.plan` hook
    above -> `reel_retention.plan:371`, which calls `_durable_sessions(HERE)` and so passes
    `reel_retention.HERE` EXPLICITLY into `frame_authority.witness_index`. An explicit root means
    `witness_index`'s own `root or HERE` fallback never fires, so patching `frame_authority.HERE`
    does NOTHING here — tried, measured, still 4 of 8, and the hook was reverted rather than kept
    with a comment claiming a containment it did not deliver. The `RR.plan` hook redirects the
    SHELF and not the DURABLE-STORE ROOT: a half-redirect of the same shape
    `test_import_bound_paths.py` records for `board_sync.REPO`/`TASKS`.

    NOT fixed here, deliberately: the corpus carries no `vault_accum`/`vault_seen`, so redirecting
    that root would make `witness_index` report `haveIndex: False`, which is the input that decides
    whether `reel_retention` holds every reel. That is a verdict change and needs its own
    measurement, not a line added to a hook list at the end of an unrelated fix.

    ⚠ THE SWEEP'S FIRST RUN NAMED TWO MORE, AND BOTH WERE THE INSTRUMENT: macOS `/var` is a symlink
    to `/private/var`, so `abspath` on a tempdir compared unequal against itself. `realpath` on both
    sides and they had been inside the corpus all along. The same sweep on a RUNNER reported
    "0 of 8 contained" — also the instrument: a tree with no stores has nothing to leak, so

#: ⚠ NOT ON THE LIST, WITH THE REASON — because a probe missing silently is the failure this file

#:
#:   declared_vs_content.report — its no-data path could not be driven from outside in the time
#:       this was written: emptying reel_story leaves its own reel-dir walk untouched, so the stub
#:       does not reach it. It is UNTESTABLE-aware (that IS its live verdict), so the question it
#:       would be asked here is one it already answers — but "already answers" is a claim I did not
#:       prove, and an unproven claim does not earn a line above. Open.
#:   store_owners.audit — publishes `ok`/`rows`/`why` and NO `state` at all. It is a different
#:       shape, not a probe that forgot to say UNKNOWN, and widening the law to cover it would
#:       change what the law means. Left out deliberately.
NOT_COVERED = ("declared_vs_content.report", "store_owners.audit")

#: The number of probes this law covered when it was last deliberately changed. It may only RISE:
#: adding a probe is free, removing one needs a reason written down, because the run stays green
#: either way. Kept as a constant so no test NAME has to restate it. [[label-outlived-referent]]
#:
#: ⚠⚠ AND IT WAS SET BELOW THE ACTUAL COUNT, WHICH IS A RATCHET THAT PERMITS A SILENT DROP. I wrote
#: 6 while PROBES held 7, so removing one left the floor satisfied and the run green — exactly the
#: silent loss this constant exists to catch. Found by a sabotage that removed a probe and PASSED.
#: A floor below the real number is not a floor, it is a formality.
FLOOR = 8

#: ⚠⚠ WHICH PROBES THE PER-PROBE UNREADABLE-SOURCE LAW REACHES, AND WHICH IT DOES NOT — because
#: its first cut covered THREE of six and nothing said so, which is how a law quietly means less
#: than its name. `per_reel_routes` and `printer.stream` read nothing themselves: their source is
#: other probes' modules, and breaking those is what the OWNERS' own cases already do. That is a
#: reason, not an excuse, and it is written down so the next reader can disagree with it.

        Measured with a sentinel in the exception message: **only 1 of 6 probes ever reported the
        blocked read.** The rest answered UNKNOWN because the patch broke the IMPORT MACHINERY —
        `one_start_point` said *"the recorder would not import"* — so they never reached their own
        read at all. The law claimed to prove *a probe survives an unreadable source* and actually
        proved *a probe survives a process where nothing can be opened, including imports*. Every
        one of them passed, and five passed vacuously.

        So each probe's OWN source is broken instead of the world's: a path that exists and cannot
        be read as what the probe expects. And the reading must NAME the failure — a probe that
        answers UNKNOWN for an unrelated reason is exactly the vacuous pass this replaces.
