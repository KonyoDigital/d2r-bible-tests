"""THE REMOVAL JOURNAL FORKS LIKE THE STORE IT DESCRIBES.

⚠⚠ THIS GATE WAS NAMED IN PROSE AND NEVER BUILT. bible.html's removal door says, in as many
words, "Gated by test_the_removal_journal_forks_like_the_store.py" — and a repo-wide find returned
ZERO hits. For as long as that sentence has been there it has described a guard that does not
exist, which is worse than no sentence: the next reader stops looking.

WHAT IT GUARDS, in the door's own words:

    "d2r_owned is in neither _LP_FORKED nor _WP_FORKED, so LSR resolves it BARE in all four worlds
     (owner main/ladder, guest main/ladder). d2r_vaultRemoved is in neither set either, so the
     journal forks exactly like the store it describes. A journal that forked differently would
     offer a restore for names the active world never held."

⚠ THE INVARIANT IS "THE SAME AS", NOT "UNFORKED". If d2r_owned is ever forked deliberately, the
journal must move with it. A law that pinned "unforked" absolutely would go red on a correct
change and, worse, would be satisfied by the two drifting apart in the other direction. What
cannot happen is a journal and its subject living in different worlds: restore would then offer
names the active world never held, and v2692 already shipped that hazard in reverse — a one-shot
guarded only by "the foundLog is not empty" applied his personal ruling to his cousin's board,
12 items.

⚠ PARSED FROM THE FORK SETS, NOT GREPPED. The door's own comment NAMES both keys while explaining
why they are absent from those sets, so a substring test would be satisfied by the explanation.
