"""v1595 — THE VAULT ACCUMULATOR'S LAWS, proven rather than asserted.

Konyo: *"the vault manager is synced to also slowly analyze and remember especially between and
among sessions ... and slowly also feed the vault manager for throwing out or muling the items read
at the time."*

Accumulating a picture of what he owns ACROSS sessions is a different risk profile from a single
read, and every test here exists because of one specific way it could quietly ruin his stash:

  MERGE-MAX — a later read that sees FEWER items must never subtract. An obstructed or half-scrolled
  stash frame is a NORMAL event, not evidence he threw something away. Get this wrong and the
  accumulator slowly eats his own inventory, one bad frame at a time, while looking like it is
  working.

  THROW-OUT NEEDS MORE EVIDENCE THAN KEEP — there is no un-throw in Diablo. It is the only
  irreversible action in the whole app, so it carries a higher bar and stays a SUGGESTION.

  ORDER MUST NOT MATTER — sessions arrive in whatever order the sweep happens to read reels. If
  merge(a,b) and merge(b,a) can disagree, the ledger depends on disk order, which is not a fact
  about his stash.

  MISSING IS NOT ZERO — a count nobody could read stays unknown, with a reason. An invented zero is
  indistinguishable from "he has none of these", and that is what drives a throw-out.

The workflow that built vault_retro.py left this file unwritten and said so; its own ad-hoc poke
used rows with no `name`/`lane`, which `_rows_of` correctly drops, and it read the empty result as
possible breakage rather than a malformed probe. These tests use the real row shape.
