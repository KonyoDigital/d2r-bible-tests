"""v2746 — THE LEDGER AUTHORITY, and every law in it driven RED before it is trusted.

Konyo's ask, on Dean's fleet card reading "⚠ running on the OWNER'S SEED" above SETS 128/135,
UNIQUES 249/403, RUNEWORDS 94/99:

    "how does that get removed what of him to do? like it should read he hasnt yet synced his
     uniques.. sets and runewords has been verified by him already and accepted.. maybe thats like
     a little toggle also needed to bypass this?"

WHAT EACH TEST BELOW HAD TO SURVIVE. A guard that has only ever been green is measuring nothing, so
every law here was sabotaged and watched go red, and the sabotage is named in the docstring with
the number it moved. Two of them are AST laws rather than text laws, because in this repo a
text-presence suite once passed 7/7 over a write sitting under `if False:`.

⚠ THE MEASUREMENTS ARE FROM HIS LIVE BOARD, 2026-09-06, and they are what these tests are calibrated
against — but NOT what they assert. Pinning 246 would freeze today's seed into a law, and the seed
is the one thing in this feature that must be free to grow. The laws assert the RULE; the numbers
appear only in comments, as the reason the rule exists.

    uniques    292/403   246 of 311 chronicle rows carry a seed name AND the seed's own date
    sets       123/135   108 of 123                                  ->  15 earned here
