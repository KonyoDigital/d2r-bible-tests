"""♥♥ HEART 2.0 — the law that the heart can see whether its own instruments still work.

**MEASURED 2026-09-08, and it is the entire argument for this layer.** The heart was GREEN while
12 of 238 gates were red, 8 of those were blind instruments, and the full set had been failing in
CI since 2026-09-07 06:12 — 28 of the last 40 runs. Every check the heart made was working.
Nothing was checking the checkers, so nobody knew. Three of the eight were laws that had silently
STOPPED MEASURING what they claimed while staying green.

    heart v1   is the SYSTEM healthy?   — lanes, routes, stores, the console
    heart v2   are my own INSTRUMENTS   — the gates and locks themselves
               still able to go red?

★ THE NUMBER THAT SETTLES "isn't it basically built?": 246 gates, and before this arc **0** had an
executable red-proof. Each was proven red exactly once, by hand, in a shell, and that proof
survives only as prose in a docstring. It cannot be re-run — so the number of gates that can still
go red was UNKNOWN. Not zero, not fine. Unknown. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

THIS LAW GUARDS THE LAYER, NOT THE NUMBER. It does not assert how many proofs exist — that is a
ratchet's job and it would fail every honest commit. It asserts that the machinery is joined and
cannot quietly stop working:

  · the census counts something (a 0 here means the parser broke, not that there are no gates —
    which is exactly what happened: the first cut read `g.cmd`, the field is `g.argv`, and it
    printed "0 gates / 0.0%" as though it were a measurement) [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]
  · every declared RED_PROOF is well formed, names a file that exists, and its `find` occurs the
    exact number of times it claims — a tamper that matches nothing proves nothing, and a green
    sabotage is usually the sabotage's fault [[sabotage-is-usually-the-wrong-one]]
  · the heart actually CARRIES the result, so the proving loop is not plumbing with no tap
  · and it proposes rather than repairs — a tool that edits its own guards can talk itself into
    anything [[achilles-self-carving-system]]

# every proof's `find` against the tree and this proof's own `find` then matched 0 instead of 1.
# So the file exited non-zero even with the join assertion deleted outright: --prove would report
# PROVEN without that being evidence the join law works. The one gate meant to demonstrate the
# protocol had a proof that could not tell the law from its own bookkeeping.
# This tamper breaks the census's RETURN SHAPE instead: no proof's `find` is disturbed, the
# well-formed test stays green, and only the join assertion can fail.
