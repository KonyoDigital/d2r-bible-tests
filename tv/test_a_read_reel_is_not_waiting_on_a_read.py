"""A REEL THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN READ MUST NOT BE REPORTED AS WAITING ON A READ.

He has now asked about this twice, months apart, in almost the same words.
`chronicle_retro.py:2513` records the first — *"how come they are still waiting on a sweep the
items it says in the tooltip here"* — and 2026-09-16: *"these reels and sessions havent been read
already and proccesed and filtetered and deleted already? something might be stale or not flowing
correctly.. nothing just be reading all should be swept?"*

**A read that finds nothing never clears the tag.** A reel gets read, sealed by the CURRENT vault
reader, banks 0 rows, and keeps its `panels-never-banked` tag because panel frames are still
visible in the film. So it is reported forever as needing the one thing it has already had, and
the sweep panel reads as permanently behind.

MEASURED on his tree, 3 reels on the vault lane:

    reel_s_1788195270707_36946   sealed vp2017, rows=0   <- read. not waiting.
    reel_s_1788216049718_92772   sealed vp2017, rows=0   <- read. not waiting.
    reel_s_1788821886867_76614   NO SEAL                 <- the only one genuinely waiting

The screen said **3**, and `_locked_say` called all three *"locked behind a sweep that has NEVER
RUN"* — false for two of them, about the exact sentence he reads.

⚠ **THE SPLIT IS THE POINT, NOT A SMALLER NUMBER.** A swept-barren reel is still HELD and still
counted in MB. Retention is right to keep it: *"a seal is not an extraction"*, and deleting it
destroys the only copy of panels nothing has managed to read. What was wrong was the WORD, not the
decision. A fix that merely dropped them from the count would hide 31 MB of his footage from the
one panel that explains why it is still there. [[label-outlived-referent]]

⚠ This gate calls `_split_read_from_waiting` rather than `_retention_once`, because that function
PRUNES. A gate that has to run the deleter to observe a sentence is a gate nobody will run.
