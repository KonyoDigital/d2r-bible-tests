"""The author of a version is the commit that stamped it, not a module constant.

AUTHOR_FAMILY was anthropic because Claude wrote every ship. Once the Grok code seat
stamps a version, two failures are the same bug:

  · a grok-cli look on that ship passes the gate (xai differs from the hardcoded
    anthropic), so the seat's own look counts as a second eye
  · a Claude look the recorder stored as model "claude" (it strips the parenthesis)
    is refused, because anthropic equals the hardcoded author

The stamp commit decides. A `Seat: Grok CLI (code)` or `Seat: Grok Bot (code)` line means the author family is xai.
A look counts only when its family differs from that.
