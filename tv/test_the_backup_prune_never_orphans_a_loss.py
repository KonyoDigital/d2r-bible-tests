"""v3009 (#81) — RETENTION SIZED FROM HIS OWN LOSS, WITH THE ONE FILE THAT ANSWERS IT PROTECTED.

The 2026-09-08 emptying was noticed ~3 days late and the oldest backup on disk was 69 hours too
young to say which backup predates the loss. His ruling: "it gets auto saved daily in a ledger
just incase if needed to restore." The policy: 48h rolling + first-of-day keepers for 90 days +
an EPISODE GUARD — while a d2r_storeEmptied episode is OPEN, the newest backup older than its
`at` is protected whatever its age, because deleting it would be the backup system deleting its
own reason to exist.

⚠ Deletion is the irreversible act, so every law here drives the SHIPPED function on a fixture
dir and counts what survived. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
