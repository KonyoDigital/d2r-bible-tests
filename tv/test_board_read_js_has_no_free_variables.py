"""v2735 — THE LINE THAT KILLED HIS BACKUP FOR A DAY WHILE EVERY GATE STAYED GREEN.

v2731 was written to COMPLETE the automatic ledger backup: two of his six stores had never been
copied. It shipped with this in the board-read payload:

    "rwMadeFull:(dump?rwFull:null)});"

There is no JS variable named `dump`. The `dump_stores` flag is interpolated as a bare `true`/`false`
LITERAL twelve lines above (`if(%s){stores={}...`), so the name resolved to nothing, the whole read
threw `Can't find variable: dump`, and `_ledger_snapshot_once` refused every snapshot from that
moment on.

MEASURED on his live console the same day:

    ledgerBackup.writes  0
    ledgerBackup.why     "Can't find variable: dump"
    newest backup file   80 minutes old, still the pre-v2731 three-store shape

=== WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT ===
`test_ledger_backup_covers_every_store` asserts the five stores are copied and passed throughout —
correctly, because it grades this SOURCE, and source is not a running board. CI was green on every
commit. The refusal existed in exactly one place: a string in `_LEDGER_BACKUP_STATE["why"]`, which
`/api/status` publishes and which nothing was reading. A loop that fails silently every ten minutes
looks identical to a loop with nothing to do. [[the-unjoined-end]] [[feedback-verify-not-proxy]]

=== WHAT THIS PINS ===
Python cannot typecheck a JavaScript string, but a free variable is not a type error — it is a name
used and never declared, and that IS checkable. This extracts the JS `board_ownership` actually
emits (statically, no window needed) and reports every identifier that is used, not declared, and
not a browser global.

⚠ PROVEN RED before being trusted, on the real defect and four sabotages:
    restore `(dump?rwFull:null)`      -> ['dump']         (the actual v2731 line)
    stores:stores   -> stores:storez  -> ['storez']
    dates:dates     -> dates:datez    -> ['datez']
    owner:owner     -> owner:ownerX   -> ['ownerX']
    boardLoaded:... -> boardLoadd     -> ['boardLoadd']
