"""REG-2365 — A SANDBOX NEVER CARRIES A LIVE RUN RECORD, AND THE SUITE THE HOOK RUNS FIRST NO LONGER WRITES ONE.

⚠ WHAT IT COST. REG-2361 moved the hook's tv suites ahead of the proving stage, so they now run in the tree heart2
copies a minute later. One of them, test_control's TestV2414 (the render gate's transport handler), drives
render_check.main() - and main() writes .render_verdict.json beside render_check.HERE, which that class never moved.
MEASURED in this branch's own worktree at 04:02: tv/.render_verdict.json held the class's FIXTURE verdict (abortedAt
"state-panel", renderFailures 1, chromeUpSeconds 0.0) in place of the last real render's, and every heart2 sandbox
built after it carried that file. The records a run writes into the tree it grades - the census, the render verdict,
the proposals, the red memory, the proof ledger - are not bytes a law is proved on: heart2's key leaves their names out
(_SELF_RECORDS), so a law that read one in a sandbox was proved on a live value no key held. CI checks out none of the
untracked ones and HEAD's blob of the tracked one.

THE FIX, both ends. (1) TestV2414 points render_check.HERE at a temp dir of its own. (2) heart2.make_sandbox drops
every live run record from the copy: one HEAD does not track is removed, one it tracks becomes HEAD's blob - restored
by the sandbox's own private history, so nothing reaches the real repo - and a record a gate declares in PROOF_NEEDS
stays, because that law asked for it and its key holds it. The list is heart2's _SELF_RECORDS plus
suite_verdict.RUN_RECORDS: one definition each, no third list.

These cases build a FIXTURE repo holding every record live (the tracked ledger edited past HEAD), drive the real
make_sandbox with heart2.REPO pointed at it, and read the sandbox and the fixture by name - never by listing a folder.
The TestV2414 case runs that class in a child whose render_check.HERE points at a trap: a run that forgets to move HERE
writes its verdict into the trap, never into a real tree. [[feedback-fixtures-never-touch-live-data]]
