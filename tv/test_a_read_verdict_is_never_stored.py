"""#79 — A VERDICT THE READ PATH INVENTS ABOUT ITSELF MUST NEVER BECOME STORED STATE.

MEASURED ON HIS LIVE `tv/shadow_watch.json`, 2026-09-12:

    {"_prov": {"by":"control_app","at":1789166507975,"store":"shadow_watch"},
     "ok": false, "why": "the shadow reader is switched off", "lookedAt": 1789166507974}

`ok` is there and NO CALLER CAN PASS IT. All six call sites of `_shadow_watch_note` are inside
`shadow_watch_tick` (control_app.py 21318/21337/21342/21347/21350/21364) and their keyword sets —
AST-parsed, not grepped — are lookedAt / sawAt / startedAt / starts / unknown / why. Never `ok`.
Nor did any commit ever pass it: `git log -S'_shadow_watch_note(ok'` is empty.

WHERE IT CAME FROM. `_shadow_watch_note` seeded itself with `cur = shadow_watch_state()`, and that
function exists to answer a READER, so each of its failure paths returns a DIAGNOSTIC dict wearing
`ok`: `{"ok": False, "why": "the record is unreadable: ..."}`, `{"ok": False, "why": "the record is
not a mapping"}`, `{"ok": True, ..., "why": "the watcher has never written a record"}`. One
unreadable moment therefore became the seed of the next write; `cur.update(kw)` laid the tick's
real fields on top, and the lockless read-modify-write carried the sentinel forward every 20 s
thereafter, because nothing ever removes a key. The record above is the result — a CHIMERA, a true
current `why` from a real tick beside a false stale `ok` from a different event.

WHAT IT COST, measured by running both consumers against both shapes:

    health_engine.check_shadow_watch   POISONED -> unknown        HEALED -> ok
    corroborate shadow-armed-is-watching   right() -> None (UNGRADED)  ->  gradeable

Both test `w.get("ok") is False` FIRST and give up, so one laundered key held a health row at
UNKNOWN and left a corroborator invariant ungraded — the invariant guarding "an evening of play
produced no reels while the panel read 'armed'". check_shadow_watch's own docstring cites
[[label-outlived-referent]]; it was an instance of the scar it was written to catch.

THIS LAW PINS THREE THINGS, each of which was separately wrong:
  1. the writer seeds from the PERSISTED record, never from the reader's diagnostic;
  2. `ok` is dropped on the way out, which also HEALS the poisoned record on the next tick;
  3. the write is ATOMIC — a plain open(...,"w") truncates before json.dump runs, and the
     unreadable file that leaves behind is exactly what mints the sentinel in the first place.
     The defect was circular: the torn write CAUSED the bad read that poisoned the store.

⚠ THE BEHAVIOURAL TEST IS THE REAL ONE. The three source checks below can only see the shapes I
thought of; only the round trip proves a poisoned record actually heals.
