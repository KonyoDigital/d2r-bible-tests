"""v3768 — A GATE CARRIES WHEN GIT SAYS ITS INPUTS HAVE NOT MOVED SINCE THE PROOF.

A version was paying for about four full `run_gates` passes, each one re-proving gates whose inputs
had not changed. Hashing every input of every gate on the way back in cost as much as running them.
This ledger does not do that.

A PASS is stored with the commit it was proved at. The next `--changed` run asks git once:

    git diff --name-only <proven_sha>..HEAD
    git status --porcelain

and intersects that set with each gate's inputs. Each stored PASS keeps its own commit. A later
PASS at a new HEAD does not discard the others: a gate carries while its commit is an ancestor
of HEAD and none of its inputs are in `diff(that commit..HEAD)` plus the dirty worktree. One
diff per distinct commit, cached for the run.

The input map is reused while `tv/run_gates.py`, `BLUEPRINT.md` and `tv/heart2.py` are the same
bytes. A row is rebuilt when the gate script, heart2.py, or any file already in its closure is
in the change set, and a PASS is stored from a fresh parse, not from that cache. The runner
file is not an input of every gate: heart2 imports it, and that walk would otherwise rerun
everything when a Gate is registered. The hashed Gate definition covers that. A gate that
itself imports or names the runner still depends on it. `bible.html` is an input of a
gate that opens it, or that reaches a function which opens it. A string in an
imported module does not count, and importing a module that only names the file
does not either.

A gate whose inputs are not in the set is printed as `proven at <sha> (<age>)` and its files
are not opened.

REG-2293 round 5 — THE PROOF REMEMBERS WHAT THE GATE READ. A static walk cannot see every read:
a glob inside an imported module, `p = path or BIBLE; open(p)`, a handler reached by dispatch. So
run_gates runs each gate with gate_trace/sitecustomize.py armed (an audit hook on open, listdir,
scandir, glob, stat, import and every child process), and the PASS stores what that run read:

    inputs   the static walk plus every repo file the run opened or stat'ed
    listed   every repo directory it listed (not the import system's own listings)
    imports  every non-stdlib module name it imported, found or not

`lookup` compares `git diff --name-status --no-renames` plus `git status --porcelain
--untracked-files=all` with the stored set AND today's walk, so a deleted input is still an
input. An added or deleted file under a listed directory, or a new module whose name the gate
imported, is a hit. `record` refuses a PASS when a dirty or untracked path is one of those
inputs, or a tracked file under a listed directory was added or deleted in the worktree, since the
commit it would be labelled with is not the bytes it ran on. An untracked file the run could only
see in a listing is kept as a snapshot (`untracked`); one that comes or goes later is a hit.
A node child carries gate_trace/node_trace.cjs and is traced the same way. A run the hook could
not follow is never stored, so the gate always runs: no trace, a child that is not python or node
(chrome, bash, a git command that reads history or the index), a child that did not trace itself,
an ES module from this checkout, a read of a gitignored file (except the two keyed caches below),
or a listing of a directory that holds no tracked file. A row stored before this change has no
`traced` mark and runs once.

Fail closed. A missing or unreachable proven sha, a diff that fails, a gate whose inputs cannot
be named, a corrupt ledger, and a FAIL are all a run. Only a PASS is stored. `--full` does not
consult the ledger. GitHub CI does not either. The changed-law red-proof (v3292) is a different
stage and does not read this file.

The files are per checkout, gitignored, and never a verdict of record. CARRY is not a fresh pass
and it does not bank Wilson evidence.

    python3 tv/gate_ledger.py --carry NAME     exit 0 and "proven at <sha> (<age>)", or exit 1
    python3 tv/gate_ledger.py --record NAME    needs suite_verdict for these bytes AND a trace, so a bare
                                               --record says why and stores nothing; run_gates stores
