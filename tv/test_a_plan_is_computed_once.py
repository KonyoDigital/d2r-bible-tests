"""REG-1410..1414 (#66) — ON A CONSOLE, reel_retention.plan() IS COMPUTED ONCE, AND NEVER SERVED STALE.

HIS WORDS: "the windows needs proper care and attention.. its needs to work perfectly and smoothly there".

MEASURED on his ALT (Windows + Boosteroid, ~30 reels, ~21,000 frames) right after v3522 landed, with py-spy
dumps of the console:
  (A) ~15 min of /api/status at 11 s, then timeouts: ONE hot thread, tvd-eagle-watch, held the GIL in
      frame_authority.test_referenced_reels -> _executable_only -> tokenize over EVERY tv/*.py, reached through
      reel_retention.plan(). That scan's key moves on every ship, so every ship paid it again.
  (B) then /api/river timed out at 90 s: THREE threads (tvd-retro-triage, tvd-eagle-watch, an HTTP request) were
      each inside frame_ref.Index.__init__ at the same moment. plan() is called from ~62 places and remembered
      nothing, so every lane re-listed the whole shelf and rebuilt the proof set from scratch, concurrently.

On an ALT-shaped fixture here (31 reels, 21,205 files; 3 plan() callers + reel_story.story at once), v3522:
cold 114-154 s (7,232 files tokenized, 4 index builds, 284 folder listings), warm 4.6 s. After: cold 0.69 s (1 index
build, 0 tokenized), unchanged 0.02 s (0 builds, 0 listings), a live frame landing 0.58 s (only the live folder
re-listed), and all five rounds' plans byte-identical to v3522's.

  · DRIVEN: 4 concurrent callers -> ONE computation and one index build; every answer a private copy.
  · DRIVEN: plan() and plan(<the same tree>) - reel_story's call and _vault_owed_reels' - are ONE computation
    while each ledger has one copy, and two when HERE and hist both hold one (the order then decides the answer).
  · DRIVEN: an unchanged world is served and lists no folder; OFF the console nothing is remembered.
  · DRIVEN, DIFFERENTIAL: every input plan() reads is moved in turn - each ledger, the triage store, the evidence,
    the tombstone, a durable store, a reel's index.json rewritten IN PLACE, a frame added, a reel removed, a nested
    folder, the ratchet - and after each the console's answer must equal a from-scratch answer, and must have
    been recomputed. A memo that serves a stale "may delete" is worse than none.
  · DRIVEN: an input that moved less than RACY_S ago is computed fresh and never kept; only a changed folder is
    listed again; a folder holding a write in flight (*.tmp) is never kept.
  · DRIVEN: the console path never tokenizes a test file; a ratchet that will not read falls back to the exact
    scan (UNKNOWN is not empty); exact=True always scans.
  · DRIVEN: reel_router's filmed-at reads the same kept listing (one more whole-shelf walk per route()).
  · JOINED: the ratchet law asks for the exact set.

THE ADVERSARIAL REVIEW OF alt-speed (8b5ecd0a), each finding reproduced and then DRIVEN here:
  · REG-1436 DRIVEN: control_app.main() runs its boot prefix under stubs on a fixture shelf - nothing it asks
    before the mark may reach the exact scan. The co_names check this replaces stayed green with the mark one
    line too late: status_payload() for the boot banner reached plan() -> the tokenize scan, once per ship.
  · REG-1437 DRIVEN: while a writer drops a loose frame into hist every 0.2 s (his footage writer, ~1 s), no
    input is ever still, so nothing may be remembered - but concurrent callers share one run, and none is handed
    a run that began before its own call: each answer equals a from-scratch plan taken after that call began.
  · REG-1438 DIFFERENTIAL: a loose frame at hist root whose STEM a citation names flips its reel between
    holds-proof and eligible, and only hist's own folder key sees it arrive or leave.
  · REG-1439 DRIVEN: on a console whose ratchet will not read, the exact scan decides the fixture set from files
    the fingerprint does not cover - so no plan is kept, and an edited test moves the next answer.
  · REG-1440 (docs) the working-tree gap is stated in frame_authority.test_referenced_reels.
