"""#54 — EQUIPPED ITEMS, PIXEL-EXACT, PER CHARACTER, CARRIED ACROSS THE HOURLY REELS OF ONE GAME SESSION.

WHAT EXISTED, so that this adds rather than duplicates:
    slot_identity.EQUIP_SLOTS      six doll slots MEASURED in frame fractions (v2375/v2376), four REFUSED
    slot_identity.worn_slot_of     a frame point -> the measured slot it lies in, or why not
    main_character                 WHICH NAMES are his gear, Wilson-scored over sightings — no slot, no
                                   pixels, no character: one ledger for whoever is logged in
    reel_door                      which door opened a reel, read once from the journal
    control_app._shadow_rollover   cuts a shadow reel every hour and re-opens ~2 s later — so ONE evening
                                   of play is N reels, and nothing joined them back together

WHAT WAS MISSING, measured before this was written (REG-340 stands: `character` appeared in ZERO journal
rows, `worn_slot_of` had ZERO callers outside its own law, and `EQUIP_SLOTS` was read by nothing but its
tests): the doll geometry was calibrated and never joined to a read; the equipment learner had no idea WHO
was wearing what; and the hourly rollover produced reels that no surface could say belonged to one game.
[[the-unjoined-end]]

THE RECORD, keyed by the character read at LOGIN / CHARACTER SELECT — the one screen that prints the
name (REG-340: the film cannot name the character during play, so the name comes from the login row and
is CARRIED). Per character, per doll slot: the item, the slot's box in THAT frame's pixels, the frame it
was seen on, how many frames saw it. A worn item whose slot cannot be told is recorded UNPLACED with the
reason — worn is a fact, the slot is a separate fact, and a guessed slot tells him he wears something he
carries. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

THE CHAIN ACROSS REELS. A login row is always a boundary: a new game session begins there. A reel that
opens WITHOUT a login continues the previous game session only when the gap between the previous reel's
seal and this reel's first row is one the rollover itself produces (ROLLOVER_GAP_MS), and it then
INHERITS that session's character, marked `carried`. Any longer gap is a reel nobody can attribute, and
its worn items land in `unattributed` with a denominator — never under the last character seen.

THE CORROBORATOR PAIR. A read may say WHICH slot in words (`names_slot`, the reader's vocabulary) and/or
WHERE (`names_xy`, a frame point). The word and the geometry are two independent sources: when both answer
and agree the slot is corroborated; when they disagree the slot is a CONFLICT and the item is UNPLACED with
both answers written down; when only one answers, that one is the answer and the record says which.
[[heart-first]] rule 1

⚠ THE READER DOES NOT EMIT THESE FIELDS YET. `_parse_read` now ACCEPTS `scene: "char-select"`, `character`,
`names_slot` and `names_xy` and writes them to the journal row, but READ_PROMPT does not ask for them,
because changing READ_PROMPT means bumping PROMPT_VER, and control_app._chron_seal_current voids every
zero-page chronicle seal on a PROMPT_VER change — a paid re-sweep of his reels. That is his decision, not
this module's, and it is written in BUGS.md REG-1522. Until then every reel reads UNATTRIBUTED and this
ledger's `characters` stays empty — an empty store with a reason, not a fabricated one.

✅ #103 STEP B (REG-1601) — THE NAME NOW COMES FROM THE CHARACTER-SELECT LEARNER. tv/char_select.py reads the
character-select screen on its own lane and, since v3530, which row is HIGHLIGHTED when he enters (a closing read of
the visit's last frame decides); ingest() joins those logins as the rows char_spans splits at, and a sealed reel waits
until the learner has walked it (cs_waits, bounded by CS_WAIT_MS). The deep reader's own `character` field stays
accepted; nothing here asks for it.

⚠ PURE: stdlib + slot_identity. No console import, so the laws drive it over a throwaway journal and the
fixture packs' frames. It decides nothing about the vault; it records.
