# Konyo: "there might be something to do with resolution for MACBOOK/WINDOWS? we had that situation
# for the AI INTAKE and we recalibrated it accordingly."  He was right, and it is worse than a
# tweak: every band above was measured on HIS MAC (2940×1912, aspect 1.538) and the caller only
# used them for 1.45 <= aspect <= 1.62. A normal Windows monitor is 16:9 = 1.778, OUTSIDE that gate,
# so his cousin's frames fell to the "foreign/windowed" fallback — the whole left 46% of the screen.
# Measured: on 1920×1080 that hands the reader a 954k-pixel slab where the Mac gets a 177k-pixel
# band. The grid arrives 5.4x more diluted, and both the tab-strip OCR and the grid fingerprint are
# reading a much emptier picture. That is "it didn't read his runestash".
#
# THE DERIVATION (not a guess): D2R scales its UI with HEIGHT and anchors the stash panel to the
# left of the viewport. So a panel spanning fraction x of the width at aspect a0 spans x * (a0/a1)
# at aspect a1; the vertical fractions do not move. One rule, every aspect.
#
# ⚠ DERIVED, NOT YET MEASURED ON A REAL 16:9 FRAME. The Mac path is byte-identical (asserted), so
# this cannot regress Konyo; it replaces a KNOWN-bad fallback with a principled band for everyone
# else. Confirm against one real Windows stash frame and, if it needs nudging, record the measured
# numbers here the way the Mac ones are recorded above.
