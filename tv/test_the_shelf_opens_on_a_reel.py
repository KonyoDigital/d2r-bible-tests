"""v3289 — THE RECORDS STRIP LEADS THE SHELF, AND THE SHELF STILL OPENS ON A REEL.

Konyo, 2026-09-18: *"the row where it says BEST RUN MOST READS TOP READS BEST COVERAGE AND STREAK
i want at the tippy top of the SHELF TAB above the sessions reels"*, then *"and the activity i
want uptop under the BEST RUNS row"*.

⚠⚠ **THIS REOPENS A MEASURED SCAR ON PURPOSE, AND THE SECOND HALF OF THIS FILE IS THE PRICE.**
v2965 measured furniture above the list at his real 1120x660: the first card at y=2491, 2101px
below the panel's own bottom edge, behind **1433px** of header, board, highlights, controls and
timeline — 530 cards rendered and not one on screen. v3121 refused the same request for the chart
for the same reason. He has now asked twice and more specifically, so it is granted — but only
with the guard that keeps the half he did not say out loud: *"those reels coming in should be
SEEN"*.

MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER, on his live console at 1120x660:

    order alone      scrollTop 0    firstCardTop 815   firstCardVisible FALSE
    order + guard    scrollTop 476  firstCardTop 235   firstCardVisible TRUE   (clientH 390)

**The guard is a timing fix, and the bug it fixes was already there.** v3029 chose the opening
scroll BEFORE `_shTimeline()` runs, and `#sh-timeline` ships with the `hidden` attribute — so at
decision time it contributes 0px and then becomes 156px, shifting everything below it after the
scroll was chosen. That went unnoticed while the timeline sat BELOW the list, where its height
could not move the cards. Putting it above turned a latent miscalculation into a shelf that opens
on furniture. [[stale-reading]]

        The routine runs TWICE — once at open, once after the chart is real. If he scrolls between

        stamps where it left the panel, and a later call acts only if it is still exactly there.

        Verified in node across four shapes: first call scrolls to 745; the second, untouched,

        scroll, so it cannot double-scroll); a shelf whose card is already visible stays at 0; and
        a panel he moved to 1200 is left at 1200.
