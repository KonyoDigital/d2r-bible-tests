"""A NEWER PUSH TO THE SAME ci/ BRANCH CANCELS THE OLDER RUN, AND MAIN IS NEVER CANCELLED (gbl/ci-speed).

MEASURED 2026-10-23 21:00-21:25 IDT: main fb2079a3 (v3791) pushed at 20:51; its Publish smoke gate waited 25.1 min
and its python suites 16.8 min for a runner, behind ~12 ci/gbl-* branch runs - some of them already replaced by a
newer push to the same branch (ci/gbl-board-winwatch had three commits' agent tests queued at once). Publish ran
about 10 min of work in a 33.9 min wall.

Every workflow a ci/** push can start now carries one concurrency block: on refs/heads/ci/* the group is the
workflow + the branch and cancel-in-progress is true, so the newer push stops the older run; on any other ref the
group is the run's own id, so the shared block never cancels a main, schedule or pull-request run - not running,
and not pending either (GitHub keeps one pending run per group and drops the rest, see publish.yml).
Two workflows keep their OWN rule, pinned here too: Publish (one group publish-main, never cancelled) and
Routine I (v699.1 his ruling: newest commit wins per ref - on main as well).

Each case evaluates the workflow's OWN concurrency expressions for a given ref and run id. RED_PROOF below.
