"""#80 — a lane that stops stamping its beat goes INVISIBLE, not red.

Every watcher lane in the console is a `while True` loop that sleeps, stamps one beat under its own
name, and does its work inside `except Exception: pass`. The beat is the ONLY thing that makes the
lane visible to `lane_liveness`, and through it to the heart. Delete it and the lane keeps running,
keeps failing silently, and reports as UNKNOWN forever — "nobody looked", which reads as fine.

⚠ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. Twelve lanes had NO sabotage evidence of their own: 163 RED_PROOFs
name control_app.py and only six landed inside a watcher loop. Evidence is credited per DEF SPAN,
so a lane earns a score only from a proof that strikes its own body. Each proof below deletes one
lane's beat, and therefore counts for that lane and no other.

⚠ AND THE SCORES STAY SEPARATE. One beat proven is `wilson_lower(1, 1)` = 0.2065 — real, and low,
which is the honest reading of a single sabotage. The organ publishes per-surface scores so these
do not drag down the lanes that earned more. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

        `_vault_autoread_loop` a SECOND stamp deliberately: it drives the paid vault sweep AND
        rides a feeder that banks names already read and costs nothing, so "one supervisor row must
        never answer for two lanes". This law was written at v3148 when one def meant one lane, and
