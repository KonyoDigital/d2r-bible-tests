    A row read `56 of 56 sabotages refused * wilson 0.646`, and 56/56 is 0.936 — the number was
    right and the words beside it named another quantity. Nobody can check arithmetic that does
    not reconcile, so a reader either trusts it blindly or stops reading it.

    THE LAW, not the number: whatever pair a scored row prints, feeding that pair back through
    the module's OWN wilson_lower must reproduce the figure printed beside it.
