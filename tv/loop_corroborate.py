"""A LOOP THAT CLAIMS TO RUN MUST HAVE LEFT SOMETHING BEHIND.

⚠⚠ WHY THE CORROBORATOR COLUMN WAS STUCK, MEASURED 2026-09-13. Ten surfaces sat at 3 of 4 organs
and every one was missing the SAME organ. Not neglect: a corroborator needs TWO INDEPENDENT
witnesses, and for a loop the natural pair is (a) it stamped a tick and (b) the trace it left.

    _ledger_backup_loop    106 backup files, newest 32 min old     <- a real trace
    _vault_autoread_loop   .vault_autoread.json                     <- a real trace
    _drift_loop · _orphan_watch · _orphan_exit_loop ·
    _shadow_watch_loop · _prune_loop · _retention_loop              <- NO trace found

SIX OF EIGHT LEAVE NOTHING AN OUTSIDE READER CAN DATE, so there is nothing to build an organ
from. Writing one for them anyway would manufacture the coverage v3055 deleted — a resolver that
matched on name tails and invented eight cells. They stay honestly ABSENT.

⚠ AND THE TICK IS NOT READABLE FROM OUTSIDE. `lane_liveness._TICKS` is an in-process dict on a
`time.monotonic()` clock. A separate process sees it EMPTY — measured: `rows()` returned 0 lanes
here while his console was healthy. Reading that as "the loops are dead" would be a fabricated
alarm about a working machine, so a missing tick is UNKNOWN, never a failure.
[[feedback-suspect-the-instrument]] [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

THE TWO WITNESSES, and they are genuinely independent:
    TICK   the loop stamped `_lane_tick(<lane>, everyS)` — in-process, authoritative, invisible
           from outside
    TRACE  the artefact it produces — a file whose mtime anyone can read

A loop whose tick is fresh and whose trace is many periods stale is a CONTRADICTION: it is
running and producing nothing. That is the finding this organ exists to surface, and no other
organ can see it — a watchdog asks only whether the thread is alive.
