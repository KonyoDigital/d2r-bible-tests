"""v3429 (#150) — THE DOCTOR MUST NOT fork() A PROCESS THAT HAS LOADED THE OBJECTIVE-C RUNTIME.

`test_control HUNG — killed after 1500s on an IDLE machine` has refused FOUR pushes since
2026-09-20, and the standing diagnosis ("the cheap subset is over budget") was wrong. MEASURED
2026-09-23, back to back, same idle machine:

    run 1 — cd.run(include_slow=False) hung 28 MINUTES at 0.0% CPU and had to be killed
    run 2 — the SAME call FINISHED IN 15.4 SECONDS, 107 rows

⚠ SO IT IS A DEADLOCK, NOT A COST, and RESUME_HERE's ">8 min alone" measured the HUNG case. Its
own puzzle — "the whole is minutes; every part is seconds" — dissolves: the parts ARE seconds. A
hang must never be averaged with a cost.

WHAT IT IS, from the stuck process: the hung parent had exactly ONE child, at 0.0% CPU, with no
grandchildren, **wearing the PARENT'S OWN ARGV** — the signature of a `subprocess.Popen` caught
BETWEEN fork and exec — and holding Quartz / CoreGraphics / QuickLookUI / PyObjC. control_app and
health_engine import those, so by the time any check shells out the Obj-C runtime is initialised,
and forking such a process without immediately exec'ing is the macOS fork-safety deadlock. 0% CPU
for 28 minutes is a lock wait; a busy loop cannot produce it.

THE ESCAPE, PROVEN BY RECORDING WHICH SYSCALL CPYTHON ACTUALLY TAKES rather than reading its
conditions:

    close_fds default (True)          -> fork_exec x1, posix_spawn x0      <- the hang
    absolute exe + close_fds=False    -> posix_spawn x1, fork_exec x0
    bare name "ps" + close_fds=False  -> fork_exec x1                      <- dirname condition

⚠ BOTH HALVES ARE LOAD-BEARING and `close_fds` DEFAULTS TO TRUE, which is why every ordinary call
forks. ⚠ AND close_fds=False IS SCOPED TO SHORT-LIVED READS: the child inherits open descriptors,
which for a long-lived worker would mean holding this console's listening socket past a restart.

==========================================================================================
v3435 (#150, reopened) — **THE CLASS LAW RECORDED TWO OF THE CONDITIONS CPYTHON CHECKS, AND
CPYTHON CHECKS FOURTEEN.**

The v3429 class law asked one question — "is the keyword `close_fds` present?" — and it asked it
only of receivers spelled `subprocess` / `_sp` / `sp`. Both halves of that were too narrow, and
each hid live forking sites:

  · **PRESENCE IS NOT VALUE.** `if "close_fds" not in kws` accepts `close_fds=True`, which is the
    fork. It also never looked at the dirname half at all, though this file's OWN sibling case
    (`test_a_BARE_executable_name_still_forks`) proves dirname is fatal on its own.
  · **THE RECEIVER SET WAS A SPELLING LIST.** `console_doctor` reaches subprocess through
    `git_quiet.run` (imported as `_gq`), a one-door wrapper that forwards `**kw` straight into
    `subprocess.run`. `_gq` is not `subprocess`, so SIX git spawns were skipped outright — and
    every one of them passes `cwd=ROOT`, which is condition six.

⚠ THE FIX IS NOT "ADD `run` TO AN ALLOWLIST". `subprocess.run` and `_gq.run` are both spelled
`run`; a guard widened on the bare attribute admits whatever else is spelled that way. Receivers
are resolved to **DOTTED module names** through the file's own import aliases, and the wrapper is
**DISCOVERED** — any module imported from `tv/` whose function forwards its `**kwargs` into a
subprocess spawner is a door, so the next `git_quiet` is seen without anyone remembering to list
it. [[a-widened-guard-admits-what-it-bans]]

⚠ AND THE NINE ARE NOT A NUMBER I TYPED. `_cpython_guard_vars()` parses
`subprocess.Popen._execute_child` **on the running interpreter** and returns the actual identifiers
its posix_spawn gate reads (14 clauses on CPython 3.9.6). A condition this file does not classify
is a RED, so a future CPython that adds one cannot silently widen the blind spot.
[[feedback-comments-vs-code]]

⚠ THE PREMISE CASES NOW CLASSIFY THE HOST, AND THEY SAY WHICH WORD THEY MEAN. The fork/spawn
premise is macOS-shaped; the gate set runs on `ubuntu-latest`. A premise case that simply passed
there would be a green that measured nothing, and one that simply skipped would be a silence.
`_host_probe()` MEASURES both control shapes at import and each host-dependent case records exactly
one of **MEASURED / NOT-APPLICABLE / UNKNOWN** with its reason, printed, and a completeness law
fails if any case recorded nothing. `0` measured is not `None` unmeasured.
[[unknown-stays-unknown]]

==========================================================================================
v3443 (#150, still open) — **THE NINE-CONDITION CLASSIFIER SHIPPED WITH SIX FALSE ALL-CLEARS IN
IT, AND THE CROSS-FAMILY EYE FOUND THEM IN TWENTY MINUTES.**

v3441 shipped the classifier; v3442 fixed one hole (identity vs truthiness — `user=0` read SPAWNS
while CPython tests `uid is None`). Five remained, and **every one graded a FORKING shape as
spawn-eligible** — the dangerous direction for a gate whose only job is catching forking sites:

  · **F3 — THE FIRST ARGV0, NOT THE LIVE ONE.** `_argv0` kept the first assignment that yielded an
    element and dropped the rest, and `_assigned_values` walked STRAIGHT THROUGH nested `def`s. So
    `args = ["/usr/bin/git", ...]` then `args = ["git", ...]` was graded on the dead spelling, and
    an inner function's argv answered for the outer one's. A one-to-many fact in a one-to-one
    store. [[one-to-one-store-for-a-one-to-many-fact]]
  · **F4 — A BARE BRANCH EXCUSED BY A STATE THAT WAS ONLY A NOTE.** `["/usr/bin/git" if ok else
    "git"]` collapsed to ABSOLUTE_IF_INSTALLED, which adds a note and no violation, so the verdict
    stayed SPAWNS while the else-branch forks. It was not even self-consistent: {BARE,
    ABSOLUTE_IF_INSTALLED} fell through to UNKNOWN and {BARE, ABSOLUTE} did not. Only a ternary
    whose CONDITION asks whether the tool is installed — console_doctor's own `_PS` line — keeps
    that state now.
  · **F5 — A JOIN IS NOT A DIRNAME.** Every `os.path.join` mapped to ABSOLUTE. `os.path.join("git")`
    returns `"git"`.
  · **F6 — THE DOOR ITSELF WAS MIS-READ.** Any `**kw`-forwarding wrapper was treated as
    transparent and only the CALL SITE was graded. A wrapper doing `kw.setdefault("cwd", REPO)`
    injects condition six into every call through it and the call site cannot show it. That is
    git_quiet's exact mechanism — it writes `kw["creationflags"]`, `kw["env"]`, `kw["startupinfo"]`
    — and it is transparent only because none of those three moves CPython off posix_spawn.
  · **F7 — A WHOLE IMPORT SPELLING COULD NOT FAIL THIS GATE.** `from git_quiet import run` binds
    its alias to the dotted name `git_quiet.run`; the module scan did `if "." in mod: continue`, so
    the module was never opened and the call matched no door. `async def` wrappers were skipped
    too. Door DISCOVERY missing a door is not a green — it is the same defect class as the
    receiver allowlist that hid six forking sites. [[presence-law-vs-reachability-law]]

⚠ **F6 AND F7 ARE THE STRUCTURAL PAIR.** F3/F4/F5 mis-grade a door that was found; F6 and F7 mean
the door is never found, or is found and then graded on half of itself.

⚠ **EVERY FIX CARRIES ITS BASELINE, because the cure here kills the patient very easily.** The ten
live console_doctor sites go through `_spawnable()` and `git_quiet.run`; a classifier tightened
without care reddens or blanks all of them and the gate becomes an alarm nobody can act on. Each
new case therefore asserts the CORRECT shape still reads SPAWNS: one absolute assignment, a
closure reading its enclosing scope, the `_PS = "/bin/ps" if os.path.exists(...) else "ps"`
ternary, a real absolute join, a site that passes `cwd` itself past a `setdefault` wrapper, and
git_quiet's own write-only-Windows-keys shape. [[the-cure-that-kills-the-patient]]
