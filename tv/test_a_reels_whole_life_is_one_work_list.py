"""#36 — A REEL'S WHOLE LIFE IS ONE WORK-LIST, AND THE FAR STATION IS REACHABLE.

MEASURED 2026-09-09 against his real stores. Every source feeding `reel_router.route()` walks what
is CURRENTLY ON DISK. The moment `reel_retention.apply_plan()` removes a reel's directory that reel
is written into `tv/reel_tombstones.json` and vanishes from every list the printer/router chain
touches:

    live per-reel work-list           41
    closure ledger                   428   (all distinct — ZERO overlap with the 41)
    one roster spanning a life       469
    covered by the per-reel surfaces  41/469 = 8.7%   |  invisible: 428/469 = 91.3%

Consequence, in the module's own words: `reel_router.STATIONS` declares TOMBSTONE, **no code path
in `_station_of()` or `route()` ever assigned it**, `counts["TOMBSTONE"]` was structurally always 0,
and `route()["unreached"]` named it EVERY RUN — the system reporting its own gap to nobody. So
`river_lanes`' TOMBSTONE lane, labelled *"closed out — the extraction contract is satisfied"*, could
only ever display ROUTED-but-still-on-disk reels. It could never show a reel that had actually
closed out, which is its entire purpose. [[label-outlived-referent]] [[plumbing-with-no-tap]]

★ WHAT THIS FILE HOLDS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
It holds `roster()` to assigning TOMBSTONE, to refusing to invent a total over a half-read union,
and to counting a reel in BOTH records exactly ONCE. It also holds the join to `route()` NOT moving
— `shelf` still means "on disk" and still reconciles — because the fix he must not get is one where
41 quietly becomes 469 on a figure he reads. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]

⚠ EVERY CASE HERE IS A FIXTURE. `roster(rep=...)` takes an already-walked report and the ledger path
is redirected through `reel_retention._tombstone_path`, so this runs on any machine and never reads
his footage — Heart 2.0 calls a law it cannot re-run in a sandbox UNPROVABLE, and a gate that only
runs on his Mac is one nobody can defeat on purpose. [[feedback-fixtures-never-touch-live-data]]
