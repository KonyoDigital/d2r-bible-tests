"""#174 v-B2 — THE CHARACTER BUILDER FITS AT EVERY WIDTH, MEASURED IN A REAL BROWSER, NOT READ FROM ITS HTML.

The node law (test_the_character_builder_is_their_builder) proves what the builder SAYS; only layout can prove it is
SEEN. The mule window taught the class, in this same room: every length on the unit and the type fixed, so between
900 and 1250 wide words were cut while innerHTML carried them whole (test_the_mule_window_fits_at_every_width). This
builder is a new window with new words — a doll that fills the centre, a modal that must never hide the slot it
serves, a stats column, an inventory — so it is measured the same way, from the first ship.

WHAT IS MEASURED, per width (2000x1300, 1280x800, 1120x628, 1024x768, 901x900, 800x1000, 375x812), in FIVE states:
the template as it opens · with Crown of Ages on the doll and Annihilus in the inventory · the helm's picker open
(Select) · the helm in Edit (the roll boxes) · the stash list open.
  · no text node in the window is cut by an overflow:hidden/clip ancestor, or lies outside its panel unless a
    scroller holds it; no CONTROL has its box sliced by what contains it
  · nothing scrolls sideways, and the window itself never does
  · no panel header's title runs into its control
  · the modal lies inside the viewport, and in the column layouts it never covers the slot it serves: the glowing
    slot's centre hit-tests to the slot (their helm glows beside their modal, 01_helm_clicked)
  · at 2000x1300 the columns are their LITERAL 322 | 716 | 300 with 6px gutters (spec §1, ±4px), the doll fills the
    716 centre, and the header type is its token (k = 1)
#174 v-B2 FIX ROUND, by real input: at 375 and 2000 the picker's list scrolls to its LAST row under a real wheel
(Weapons, 600+ rows; Boots) - at 375 the stacked pane was unbounded, the list grew to 8715px and only ~35 rows could
ever be reached; and an ACTIVE gold button under the pointer keeps its dark label (Set 1, ! Quests, Filters, the
chosen class - the hover rule painted gold text on the gold face).
#174 v-B3: at 2000 / 1280 / 375 the Edit tab of a BASE with its picked mods - a rare Diadem with four (Devil's, Ruby,
of the Magus, of the Tiger), shut and with ADD MOD open; a magic Grand Charm with Chaotic + of Vita, and with Chaotic
alone and ADD MOD open (its suffixes listed) - nothing cut, nothing outside its panel, nothing sideways, the modal on
screen and off the glowing slot, every picked mod drawn and the open list full of options.
#174 v-B3 FIX ROUND: the open ADD MOD list lies wholly inside the Edit tab's visible box and, with more options than
fit, runs to its bottom (a fixed calc(330 x u) ran ~137px below the modal at 1280x800 and stopped at 158px on a phone
with ~220px empty under it); and ADD MOD is a combobox by REAL keys at 2000 - "res" typed, ArrowDown, Enter: focus stays
in the search box, aria-activedescendant names the second option, which is the one painted, and Enter adds exactly it.
The entry is REAL INPUT: the Tools tab and the Character Builder card are pressed by CDP mouse events at their
centres, each hit-tested first; the helm is equipped the same way (the slot, the search box, the row), a roll is
typed with key events, and the charm is DRAGGED to another cell with a press, moves carrying buttons=1, a release.
#174 v-B4 - THE CHARACTER/INVENTORY TEMPLATE IS ONE PANEL (his order 2026-09-26: "the INVENTORY under the equipment
need to be structured like this JUST LIKE IT IS IN GAME one to one", "they always open and are seen as a set together").
Theirs (planner 60/61, 15_crop): one carved-stone panel, the doll and flush under it the 10x4 grid - black cells, thin
lines, no gaps, no rounded corners. Ours was a framed doll, a caption, then a separate grid with 2px gaps and rounded
gradient cells. Measured in every plain and worn state at the 7 widths AND with three charms placed through the
builder's own picker (Annihilus 1x1, a Grand Charm 1x3, Gheed's Fortune 1x3, their ids read from the database by name)
at 2000x1300 / 1280x800 / 1120x800 / 900x800 / 375x812: the grid and the doll lie inside the ONE panel; the grid's top is
within 12px of the doll's bottom with no word between them; the caption and the status line are under the panel;
10 columns x 4 rows of equal SQUARE cells edge to edge (gap 0), radius 0; the grid never wider than the doll's inner
width; cells >= 26px from 1280 up; every item's rect inside the cells it occupies, with its art; and the charms MOVE
the stats (All Skills and Strength differ from the same build before them).
#174 v-B4 FIX ROUND (two reproduced review findings):
  · AN ITEM'S TILE IS COLOURED BY ITS STATE, NEVER BY ITS QUALITY. Ours filled a unique tile gold with a gold border and a
    gold halo, a magic one blue. Theirs and the game (73_anni_tip, 15_after_drag_crop, sampled) draw a unique Annihilus,
    a unique Hellfire Torch and a magic charm on ONE indigo, (8,2,28) over the black cell, no frame, no halo; only the
    item being edited is green, (6,26,2). With the three charms at the build's own level: every tile one fill whatever
    its data-q (two qualities at least, printed), that fill over the cell within 6 of theirs, no visible border, no art
    filter; a tile pressed by REAL input goes green (theirs within 6) while the others keep the indigo.
  · A CHARM THE LEVEL CANNOT USE IS RED AND COUNTS FOR NOTHING. In the game a charm below its level requirement gives no
    bonus and its background turns red; ours kept the tile gold and STATS summed it (Annihilus req 70 at level 50: All
    Skills 1 EXACT). Every tile is red exactly when the Required Level its own tooltip prints is above the build's level,
    at three levels: the input's max, Gheed's Fortune's requirement (Annihilus's is above it - read, never typed, and
    printed), and one lower by a REAL press of the level's down arrow. At Gheed's level STATS' All Skills is the build's
    own again (Annihilus left out) while Gold Find is what it was at the max (Gheed's still counted); one lower Gold Find
    moves too; STATS names each left-out charm with its level, and Calculations lists it among the failed requirements.
    The SIBLING on the doll, same rule: its slot was already red above the level and STATS summed the item anyway, so the
    fresh build also wears Crown of Ages (its Required Level read from its tooltip, above Gheed's): red and named as left
    out exactly when the level is below it.
The fixture's fresh build is made at its level input's own max, so the charms it places can be used.
#29(d) ROUND 9 (his answers 2026-09-28, "TIGHTEN"), in every Edit state at every width (the helm at the 7 widths, the
rare Diadem and the magic Grand Charm at 2000 / 1280 / 375):
  · THE EDIT WINDOW IS AS TALL AS WHAT IT HOLDS: no more than 12px of its body lies empty under its last line (a fixed
    750-unit frame left ~40px under the helm at 2000, ~340px under a charm, ~230px on a 375 phone), and when it does
    scroll inside itself no more than 12px of the glass is free under it (at 901x900 it scrolled 97px of the helm with
    ~260px of glass unused).
  · THE BUILDER'S TABS STAY IN VIEW WHILE IT IS OPEN: in every state with a modal (Select, Edit, the stash, an inventory
    cell's picker, the mod states) and the tab row on the glass, the modal does not overlap the Equipment | Skill Tree |
    Calculations row and each tab's centre hit-tests to that tab (at 1280x800 the Edit window's top was pulled to 108 and
    covered EQUIPMENT; on a phone the sheet covered the whole glass).
  · (superseded by round 2, REG-1379) no empty band under the builder, which round 1 met by stretching the last panels.
#29 ROUND 2 (2026-09-28, the adversarial review of round 1, each finding reproduced on fe817ab7):
  · REG-1376 HIS WORDS COST NO LINE: "cap 75%" (his ruling, kept) is wider than the "≤75%" it replaced and widened the value's
    column, so a label beside it wrapped once more (Physical Damage Reduction 2 -> 3 lines at 1280x800, Lightning Resistance
    1 -> 2 at 1280 and 2000). At every width, plain and with the helm worn: every capped row's label has the lines it has with
    the cap chip taken away, the chip is one line and lies inside its row; 1280x800 and 901x900 are required.
  · REG-1379 "Tighten both": THE BUILDER IS AS TALL AS WHAT IT HOLDS - round 1 filled the band under it by stretching
    STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES and NOTES into empty boxes. At every width, plain and worn: where the window does not scroll it
    ends under its content by its own bottom padding (no band) and STATS ends with the columns beside it (it was the glass's
    height whatever stood there); where it scrolls it is the glass's height; in columns STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES and NOTES are
    no taller than their own content (or their floors) with every stretch taken away.

⚠ ITS OWN BROWSER, ON ITS OWN PORT, killed by the handle it holds (render_check._chrome_up / _chrome_down).
⚠ NO CHROME ON THIS MACHINE = a DECLARED skip (exit 77), never a pass.
#42 - A PUSH-TIME RED-PROOF MEASURES ONLY WHERE ITS DEFECT SHOWS (tv/law_widths.py). TV_LAW_WIDTHS, set only by
`heart2.py --prove --push` from a proof's own measured "widths", restricts every width loop and every one-viewport pass
(the keyboard, pointer, hover and tile passes at 2000x1300, the indent at 1280x800) to those viewports; a case whose
viewports are all outside it is a declared SKIP, and each PREMISE counts over the viewports measured (its per-width rate
unchanged). The fixture's own steps - the entry, the equip, the Diadem set before the sweep, the fresh build - run
whatever the restriction, so a restricted run meets each measured state as the full run does. Unset (run_gates, CI,
every run without --push), this law is exactly what it was.
