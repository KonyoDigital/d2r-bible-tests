"""TEXT SITTING ON TEXT — the class the render gate cannot see.

⚠⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS. `render_check` measures whether an element is CLIPPED, OFF-SCREEN or COVERED.
None of those catches two labels drawn on top of each other: both are fully on screen, neither is
clipped, and the pixels are a mess. Measured 2026-09-04 at 375x800 — a width the render gate
already renders and reports as *"no clipping"*:

    375x800    36 painted text leaves    3 overlapping pairs
    901/1120/1440                          0 overlapping pairs

⚠⚠ THOSE NUMBERS ARE THE CORRECTED ONES, AND THE CORRECTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THIS
FILE. The first version counted BOUNDING RECTS and reported 24 at 375 and 2-3 at every desktop
width. It was wrong: `getBoundingClientRect()` returns geometry for content an ancestor has CLIPPED
AWAY, and this page has one — at 375px `#home-dash` is height 0 with scrollHeight 591 and
overflow:auto, so its entire subtree has rects while none of it is painted. **21 of the 24, and
every single desktop "overlap", were invisible.** I had already written the desktop ones up as a
finding — "a 246x29px collision on his widest view" — and that finding did not exist.

Elements are hit-tested now: `elementFromPoint` at the centre must return the element or something
inside it. What is not drawn cannot collide. [[feedback-verify-not-proxy]]

A cold cross-family look at the same PNG found it unprompted — *"'AI READS · LIVE' overlaps the
partial text 'appea here'… ':17772' and ':17771' colliding with 'MILLENIUM', 'heart', and
'AGENT'"* — and the gate had just called that width green. **He must not be the detector, and
today neither was the gate.** [[visual-regression-detector]]

⚠⚠ IT IS A RATCHET, NOT A PASS/FAIL, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. There are 24 overlaps at 375px today.
A check that failed on all of them would be red from birth, and a gate that is red on arrival gets
switched off or re-baselined without being read — which is precisely how the swallow ratchet one
file over came to be cleared by `--write-baseline` instead of by fixing anything. So: the debt is
RECORDED per target per width, a RISE fails, and a FALL fails too until it is blessed deliberately.
An exact-match baseline has no slack for a new overlap to hide in.

⚠ 2 OVERLAPS AT 1120 ARE IN THE BASELINE AND ARE NOT ASSUMED HARMLESS. Nobody has read them yet.
They are debt, recorded as debt, and the ratchet stops them growing — calling them "fine" would be
a verdict nobody earned. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

#:
#: ⚠⚠ v2658 — THIS MODULE PRINTED "⚪ UNKNOWN" AND EXITED 1, AND THOSE TWO DISAGREED FOR ITS WHOLE
#: LIFE. `run_gates` maps exit 77 to SKIP and EVERY other non-zero to FAIL, so on a GitHub runner —
#: where `tv-tests.yml` installs no browser at all — this gate reported `❌ overlap_ratchet` with
#: the words *"Nothing was established, which is not the same as no overlaps"* sitting in its own
#: status column. It was counted among the 16 red gates while NINE sibling gates that print
#: `⚪ SKIPPED` were not counted, purely because they exit 77 and this one did not.
#: The contradiction was the finding: the module's message was right and its exit code was wrong.
#:
#: ⚠ THIS DOES NOT MAKE THE GATE PASS. A venue with no browser now reports a DECLARED SKIP, which
#: `run_gates` prints loudly and counts in its "did not run" line — never a tick. And a declared
#: skip that never becomes a real run is [[d2r-bible]] §8's "a gate that always skips is the same
#: defect as one that never runs", so the coverage gap is NAMED rather than closed: `tv-tests.yml`
#: needs the chromium install + `~/.cache/ms-playwright` cache that `publish.yml:97-117` already
#: has. Until then this gate measures on his Mac only, and says so on CI.
NO_BROWSER = "headless chrome would not start, so no width was measured"
