"""A SHADOW LOG NOBODY READS IS NOT AGREEMENT — board #188.

`tv/g5_grok_eyes.py::g5_shadow_log()` has written `claude_names` / `grok_names` / `claude_scene` /
`grok_scene` since 2026-08-23. Those four keys occur at exactly FOUR lines tree-wide and ALL FOUR
ARE WRITES — the file had never been opened for read. Measured by hand on his live store the day
this gate was written (6,082 rows, 2026-08-23 23:06:14 -> 2026-09-14 18:05:20): of the 1,596 rows
where BOTH lanes answered, 1,079 (67.6%) carried different NAME lists and 968 (60.7%) a different
SCENE — while `tv/g5_grok_eyes.state` read {"on": true, "mode": "primary"}.

**The promotion to primary rested on evidence nobody had ever looked at.** `tv/g5_shadow_reducer.py`
is the read side. This gate is what stops the reader from lying.

The five ways a reader like this goes quietly wrong, each with a law below:

  1. IT PICKS A WINNER. The moment a reducer says which lane was right, the 67.6% stops being a
     finding about the instruments and becomes a scoreboard. LAW_SYMMETRY drives the reducer twice
     — once with the lanes swapped — and pins that agree/disagree are IDENTICAL while the one-sided
     counts trade places. A reducer that prefers a lane cannot pass that.
  2. IT COUNTS SILENCE AS DISSENT. 4,486 of his 6,082 rows have grok silent. Folding those into the
     denominator would have turned 67.6% into a number about lane availability. LAW_BUCKETS pins
     one-sided and neither into their own buckets and out of the agreement denominator.
  3. IT PUBLISHES A BARE PERCENT. LAW_EVERY_FIGURE walks the whole report and fails any figure that
     does not carry n, d, pct AND its window together. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]
  4. IT REPORTS 0.0% FOR NOTHING-MEASURED. LAW_ZERO_DENOM pins pct=None when d=0.
     [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
  5. IT READS HIS LIVE STORE. tv/g5_shadow.jsonl is gitignored and per-machine; a gate that reads
     it is green here and red on origin for reasons that are not the code. LAW_NO_IO proves through
     the COMPILER that reduce_rows and every helper it calls name no file primitive at all, so a
     test can only ever hand it fixtures. [[feedback-fixtures-never-touch-live-data]]

And one join law, because a reader wired to keys the writer does not write is the same defect in
the other direction: LAW_JOIN parses tv/g5_grok_eyes.py with `ast` (never imports it — importing
touches his per-machine state and budget files) and pins that every key the reducer reads is a key
`g5_shadow_log` actually writes, and that the reducer's default path is the writer's `_SHADOW_LOG`.

⚠ EVERY LAW HERE DRIVES THE REDUCER AND READS ITS VERDICT. Not one asserts arithmetic about what
the reducer ought to compute. [[a-law-about-a-row-must-drive-the-row]]
