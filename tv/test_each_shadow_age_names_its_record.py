"""#218 (REG-3034, GrokBot v3836 glass pass, #230 6485132266) - EACH AGE IN A SHADOW NAMES THE RECORD IT DATES.

At 03:13 the Mac's shadow of the ALT said "last upload 44 min ago · snapshot Oct 29 02:28" on its bar, and "uploaded 12 min
ago" atop 📚 Their sessions in the same view. Measured on the site at 03:49: the ALT's board snapshot (the profile record)
t 03:43:39, exactly 02:28 + the console's 75 min profile gap (console_snapshot.MIN_GAP_MS, REG-2684, which holds a boot
post too); its sessions digest t 03:00:36; its roster row t 03:00:34. So the 03:00 restart published a row and a digest
and no board - the shadow loaded the newest board there was, and nothing older over anything newer. Both ages were true;
each read as "the owner's last upload". Now the bar says "board uploaded N ago" (console_snapshot.view) and the list
says "sessions uploaded N ago" (control_ui _shadowSessionsHtml), so the two ages never read as one.

Driven: console_snapshot.view and shadow_sessions.view in Python; the list's header and its helpers cut out of
control_ui.html and run in node over the real shadow_sessions.view answer. RED_PROOF below.
