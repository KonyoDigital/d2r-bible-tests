"""THE ONE PLACE THAT SAYS WHAT A ROUTE COUNTS.

⚠⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS. Three route sets print a number per tab, and until v2484 each read a DIFFERENT
producer. The heart showed this, and every number in it was right:

    tab            chronicle routes   fleet lanes   roster routes
    runeword(s)         105                99            99
    set(s)              135               135           135
    unique(s)           398               403           403

chronicle_routes read the roster ARTIFACT (a file of name strings); fleet_routes and roster_routes
read the live TALLY. Konyo, on being shown the table: "sync and match them obivously.. no reason to
have this gap".

WHAT THE DEMOTED NUMBERS ACTUALLY ARE — neither is wrong and neither is deleted:
  · 105 is runeword_roster.json's length: 101 declared rows + 4 extra BARE forms. Both spellings
    are kept on purpose ("Spirit (sword)" and "Spirit") because a chronicle page prints the bare
    one. It was never a count of runewords. control_app.py already refuses to use it as a
    denominator, in as many words, and that refusal still stands.
  · 398 is unique_roster.json's length — every unique this board can put a NAME on. The chronicle
    has 403 entries; the difference is items the game will not name until they drop.

THE TRUE COUNT PER TAB, and where it comes from:
    runeword  99   var RUNEWORD_CHRONICLE_TOTAL  — his v2192 ruling, 2026-08-27
    set      135   the piece catalogue in bible.html — 34 sets, 135 distinct pieces
    unique   403   chronTotal / UNIQUE_CHRONICLE_TOTAL — his v1751 ruling, re-derived from the
                   game files: 439 rows − 24 disableChronicle = 415, − 12 not-spawnable = 403

⚠ IT READS bible.html, NOT THE ARTIFACTS, so the artifacts stop being denominators and become
checked copies. And every failure returns None, never a fallback constant: a number nobody could
read is UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN must not render as a total. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

⚠ NOT the same file as tv/chronicle_total.py — that one BANKS the dated CASC measurement for
uniques (439/24/415/403/396) and is the evidence. This one is the reader the surfaces quote.
