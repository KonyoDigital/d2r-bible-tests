"""#83 (REG-1515) — THE CHILD SUPERVISOR: one door every long-lived child of this checkout goes through.

His words, 2026-09-29, after FIVE capture_win.ps1 leaked at once and dwm.exe died under them, taking Boosteroid:
*"have a logic coded for this so it bypasses it - architecture something smart to make the ascending of the reel
sessions smooth"*. REG-1502/1509 closed the capture's own races; this is the architecture under all of them.

WHAT A ROLE IS. A role is a NAME for one long-lived child this process keeps - "capture" (capture_win.ps1),
"vision-r0".."vision-rN" (the warm `claude -p` readers), "vision-stall" (the stall-drain reader), "ocr" (the fast
lane's worker). By construction a role holds AT MOST ONE process: `spawn(role, argv)` ends the role's previous
instance first, waits a bounded time for it to die, and only then starts the new one. That is the whole "ascending
of the reel sessions": the next session's capture cannot exist beside the last one's.

WHAT "ENDS" MEANS - THE WHOLE TREE, VERIFIED:
  · Windows: each role's process is put in a Job Object with JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE (ctypes, no
    package). A grandchild (powershell's conhost, claude's node helpers) is born into the job and dies with it;
    TerminateJobObject ends the tree in one call, and if THIS process dies without ending anything the OS closes
    the handle and the tree goes with it. When the assignment fails (a launcher already holds us in a job on a
    Windows that cannot nest) the receipt says so and taskkill /T remains the fallback.
  · POSIX: start_new_session, so the child leads its own process group and killpg ends what it spawned.
  · A record carries role / pid / birth (process creation time) / parent. A pid is only ended when it is still
    OURS: our own unreaped Popen (the kernel holds that pid for us), or - for a record left by a previous life of
    this console - a live pid whose creation time matches the record within BIRTH_TOL_S. A pid the OS handed to a
    newer process is a stranger and is dropped, never killed. UNKNOWN birth decides nothing and kills nothing.

THE LEDGER. Every spawn/end writes this process's records to one JSON file per parent under LEDGER_DIR (a temp dir
keyed by this checkout, or TV_CHILD_GUARD_DIR). A console that starts after a crash reads the files of parents
that are gone and ends their children - verified by birth - so a dead console's capture is not filming his
desktop when the next one boots. The agent's workers live in the agent's own file, so the console's watchdog can
see them too.

THE WATCHDOG (`watchdog_tick`, the console's rescue loop): (1) ends the recorded children of dead parents;
(2) reads the process table for processes of KNOWN roles that carry this checkout's path and ends the UNRECORDED
ones whose parent is gone or is one of ours - an unrecorded child with a live stranger parent (another console's)
is counted and said, never ended. An unreadable table is UNKNOWN: nothing is ended and `owed` is None, never 0.

MEMORY. `free_ram_mb()` reads available RAM (GlobalMemoryStatusEx / MemAvailable / vm_stat) or None when it
cannot; `secondary_spawn_allowed()` refuses a secondary worker (the stall reader, OCR) while free RAM is under
RAM_FLOOR_MB. A warm `claude -p` measured ~400 MB on his PC; the default floor leaves room for two and dwm's own
headroom, the thing that actually died. UNKNOWN free RAM never refuses - a refusal on a guess is the fail-always
the doctor row would then never see. [[unknown-stays-unknown]] [[heart-first]] [[copy-drift]]
