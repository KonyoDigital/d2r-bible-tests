"""2026-09-27 — A BATCH BUILT ON AN INTEGRATION BRANCH SHIPPED CODE NO EYE COULD BE SHOWN.

v3515-v3517 were built in worktrees, merged, then stamped as three bump-only commits. The runner looks at the
ONE commit a version is bound to, so v3517's look was 2,692 chars of version strings and the eye answered
cannot-tell - correctly - and re-asking could only answer the same. The v3518 push was then refused at the
gate for a look no re-ask could ever supply.

`second_eye_run.py vNNNN --base REV` widens the look to every change from REV to the bound commit, the prompt
says the diff spans N commits, and the row says what it covered. Measured on v3517: 2,692 -> 460,877 raw diff
chars (shared into the 26,000 cap across the changed files), and the eye came back with 6 findings, one of them
a real regression (a key stack locked no longer; reproduced and fixed in v3519).

DRIVEN on a throwaway git repo (never this one - CI checks out one commit deep): feature, then a bump-only stamp.
RED_PROOF below.
