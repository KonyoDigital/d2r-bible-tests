"""THE RIVER, MADE VISIBLE AS THE FOUR LANES HE NAMED.

Konyo: *"the visual rendering of it i want it replicating a simple · INTAKE where the reels come
and get stationed · PRINTER where they get filtered · CAPTURE where they get extracted.. and
finally TOMBSTONE... first in first out FIFO.. that way its optimzed."*

And the constraint that shapes every line of this: *"now dont get me wrong. the backend should be
pinpoint perfect and nothing fabricated what so ever.. just the visual rendering of the backend."*

So `river_lanes` DECIDES NOTHING. `reel_router.route()` decides; this groups its answer.

MEASURED on his shelf the day this shipped (40 reels, reconciles true):

    INTAKE       7   INTAKE:0 + TRIAGE:0 + STATION:7 + EMPTY:0
    PRINTER     11   PRINTER:11
    CAPTURE     16   CAPTURE:12 + JOIN:4
    TOMBSTONE    6   ROUTED:6  + TOMBSTONE:0
    TOTAL       40   = shelf

⚠ TOMBSTONE HOLDS 6 ONLY BECAUSE v2764 UNWELDED ROUTED FROM THE DELETER. Before that the last lane
could never hold anything — the only writer of a tombstone row lived inside the deleter, behind the
arming lock, so "finished" and "deleted" were one event and the lane was a labelled empty box.

=== ⚠⚠ THE DEFECT THAT COST THE MOST, AND IT WAS A NAME ===
The strip was first called `_shRiverRender` / `_shRiverLoad`. **`_shRiverLoad` ALREADY EXISTED** at
the bottom of control_ui.html — the SHELF_RIVER card-grouping feature. Two function declarations
with one name in one scope: the later wins, silently. The whole strip was unreachable while every
piece of it measured correct — the container rendered, the export was on `window`, the fetch fired
and returned 200 with a good payload, and NO ERROR WAS THROWN ANYWHERE. The placeholder simply
never changed.

It survived four rounds of probing because a second bug hid it: the could-not-ask branch first
rendered the SAME words as the loading placeholder, so a permanent failure and an unfinished load
were indistinguishable. Both are fixed. It was found only by printing
`window._shRiverLoad.toString()` in the page and reading back a function I had not written.

`test_no_new_duplicate_function_name` is the general guard that would have caught it in one second.
