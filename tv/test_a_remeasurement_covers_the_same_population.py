"""v3320 — A RE-MEASUREMENT COVERS THE POPULATION OF THE FIRST MEASUREMENT.

`test_the_cheap_subset_is_actually_CHEAP` measures the every-tick doctor roster, and when the total
goes over budget it re-measures and keeps `min(first, second)` — because a wall-clock figure moves
2.7x between runs of identical code, and for a floor-bounded quantity the minimum is the honest
estimator. That reasoning is correct. The implementation compared two different populations:

    first pass   skipped  _skip = SLOW | PERIODIC    63 checks
    the re-measure skipped  SLOW only                65 checks

MEASURED on his Mac 2026-09-18, one tick, unchanged code:

    first-pass population     4,134 ms      <- under the 9,000 ms budget
    retry population          8,859 ms
      engines corroborate     3,057 ms      ] PERIODIC — deliberately off the every-tick bill
      sweep would find        1,667 ms      ]

So `min()` ran over two different things. The retry carried a 4,725 ms surcharge the every-tick
path never pays, which meant it could only absolve a burst LARGER than 8,859 ms — and the block's
own comment calls the retry "what actually decides". It decided nothing. On 2026-09-18 it refused a
legitimate push at 10,146 ms for a subset that costs 4,134.

⚠ THIS IS THE THIRD INSTANCE OF ONE SHAPE, which is why it is a law and not a fix:
    v3313  a seed is compared only to its own population
    v3317  the heart divides by the population it counted
    v3320  a re-measurement covers the population of the first measurement
Each time the numerator was right, the denominator was a different set, and the arithmetic was
performed anyway. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]] [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

⚠ IT ASKS THE COMPILER, NOT THE TEXT. Every earlier cut of a law like this was a grep, and a grep
reads the paragraph above — which names `cd.SLOW` four times — as code. `ast` cannot see a comment
at all, so the prose that explains the defect can never satisfy the law. [[source-reading-guard]] §1

⚠ AND IT PINS WHICH SET, not merely that the sets agree. A law asserting "both loops skip the same
thing" goes green when BOTH are narrowed back to `cd.SLOW` — the defect, applied consistently. The
population must be `_skip`, and `_skip` must still be built from SLOW *and* PERIODIC.
