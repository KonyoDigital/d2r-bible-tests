"""v2802 — "RUNS SOMEWHERE" AND "RUNS UNWATCHED" ARE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES, AND ONLY ONE WAS GUARDED.

v2801 measured `engines corroborate` at 6,638-13,038 ms inside console_doctor's every-tick subset
and moved it into SLOW. The measurement was right. The move deleted a supervision loop, because
`_eagle_once` calls `run(include_slow=False)` — so in the unattended path SLOW does not mean "less
often", it means **never**. That check is the only caller of `corroborate.verdict()`, which holds
every cross-engine invariant the console has: owned-is-contained, chronicle-owed,
swept-split-adds-up, evidence-survived-its-sweep. After that commit a 19-vs-2 or 1263-vs-403
disagreement could only be found by Konyo pressing the eagle button himself.

⚠⚠ AND THE EXISTING MIRROR GATE WAS GREEN THROUGHOUT. `test_a_check_moved_to_SLOW_is_still_RUN_
somewhere` asks whether the FULL run still performs it. It does — that is true, and it is not the
question. The property that was removed is whether anything performs it WITH NOBODY WATCHING, and
no law in this tree asked that. It took a cross-family review of the pushed diff to say so.
[[build-the-heart-and-census-everywhere]] [[the-unjoined-end]]

THE TIER: SLOW keeps its meaning — on demand only, ~2 minutes, a human is waiting. PERIODIC is for
a check too expensive for every ten-minute tick and too important to go unwatched; it runs
unattended on a longer cadence instead of not at all.

THIS LAW GUARDS THE PROPERTY, NOT THE MEMBERSHIP. It does not care which checks are periodic. It
asserts that whatever is in PERIODIC is genuinely reached by the unattended loop, within a bounded
number of ticks, and that the loop passes a real argument rather than a constant.
