"""v2765 — THE MISSING WALL PRINTS THE QLVL, AND REFUSES TO PRINT ONE IT DOES NOT HAVE.

Konyo: *"for MISSING when it collapses open i want the q1-87 levels of the item in white same color
based but for sets.. because sets i see they dont have it... some items here in uniques are missing
the q level of there rarity. so for sets and uniques fix the rest."*

=== ⚠⚠ `qlvl: 0` IS A SENTINEL, NOT A LEVEL ===
MEASURED across all 5,925 item rows in `bible.html`, counted DISTINCT by name:

    high     126 of 127 carry a real qlvl        set        14 of 148
    grail     78 of  91                          special     0 of 4
    common    93 of 175                          uber        1 of 2

So a 0 means "this table never recorded one". Rendering it would put a confident **q0** under 134
set pieces and 96 uniques — a fabricated figure in the longest list on the page, which is exactly
where nobody would catch it. Absent renders NOTHING. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]

=== ⚠⚠ AND THE 14 SET ROWS THAT DO CARRY ONE ARE NOT PIECES ===
They are set-level AGGREGATES — "Trang-Oul set (any piece)", "Immortal King set (any)", "Aldur's
Watchtower (any)". Hanging one on a piece is the trap v2299 named two comments up in the same file
("not a set-level average standing in for a piece"), and it is easy to fall into because
`_etaHours` legitimately DOES take a set aggregate as its fallback source. The qlvl reader takes no
fallback at all. Proven on real pixels: `_qlvlOf("Trang-Oul's Wing (shield)")` -> null while
`_qlvlOf("Trang-Oul set (any piece)")` -> 65.

=== ⚠ HALF OF WHAT HE ASKED FOR IS A DATA GAP, NOT A RENDER GAP ===
He said *"sets is missing the q level"* and wanted it fixed for sets too. **134 of the 148 set
entries have no qlvl anywhere in this page** — the per-piece rows carry `"tc":0,"qlvl":0`, and the
set structure holds art and dates but no level field. Nothing was found to render, and 134 values
were NOT written in from memory to make the wall look complete. That needs the game's own SetItems
table, which is a sourcing job. `test_the_set_piece_gap_is_still_real` pins the gap so that the day
the data arrives, this file goes RED and says so instead of the fix sitting unnoticed.

MEASURED ON REAL PIXELS after the change: the F-Uniques wall renders 392 missing rows and **296**
carry a q-chip, computed colour `rgb(255, 255, 255)`. The sets wall renders 135 rows and 1 chip,
which is the honest picture of the data underneath.

# PROPOSED by tv/heart2_candidates.py — derived from this gate's OWN assertions and
# measured against the target file (each anchor occurs exactly once). Review it: the
# question is whether deleting this text is the defect the law exists to catch.
