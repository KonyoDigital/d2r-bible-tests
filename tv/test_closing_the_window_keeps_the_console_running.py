"""2026-09-29 — CLOSING THE WINDOW NO LONGER STOPS THE CONSOLE (REG-1430).

His words: *"make sure after the console is up and running there is a default ON true for shadow reader and
tooltips pass on and background service running with the console hidden always by design"* and *"that way
sessions are always working and running based on games and sessions being done regardless if the console is
on or not. a one time update to the newer version should keep it backgrounded"*.

✕ used to END everything (v935.8: "exiting the console must stop ON AIR"), so a session he played with the
window shut was never filmed. Now ✕ and Esc HIDE the console completely - his second word, 02:55: "make sure
this thing and window is completely hidden" - no window, no taskbar button, no Dock icon, and every lane keeps
running. v1460's scar (a hidden window no focus path could find) is answered by a BUILT way back: the Desktop
icon and a second launch ask the running console to show itself. ⏻ quit closes this window and the
shadow reader keeps running. A window-only view and TV_CLOSE_EXITS=1 still exit.

DRIVEN on the shipped functions with a fake pywebview window (no real window is ever opened, no quit is ever
armed - `_request_console_exit` is replaced by a recorder in every case that could reach it):
  · the close handler CANCELS the close and hides the window (not minimize); a real quit lets it close
  · a real exit records itself FIRST, so the handler knows to let it through
  · macOS leaves fullscreen before hiding and goes back to fullscreen when it returns, drops its Dock icon while
    hidden, and reads fullscreen from the window's own style bit (frame and flag both lied, measured);
    Windows hides as is and comes back with Show + SW_RESTORE, never pywebview's restore()
  · the OS minimize / restore events keep the state true to the window
  · the rescue watchdog holds while backgrounded; an update relaunch stays backgrounded; a quiet boot is
    backgrounded from its first second
  · a second launch and both launchers bring a hidden console FORWARD instead of replacing it
RED_PROOF below.
