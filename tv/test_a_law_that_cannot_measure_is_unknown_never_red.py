"""#161 (REG-3061) - A LAW WHOSE BROWSER WOULD NOT START COULD NOT MEASURE: THE GATE SET READS IT UNKNOWN, NEVER RED.

MEASURED on CI 2026-10-29: test_found_ever_never_files_to_a_mule failed the gate set twice (v3837's first grade, then
v3838), "would not start on :51565" and ":59361", each FAILED (failures=1): only its first case failed - its browser
was alive and slow under the shard's load - and the five cases after it found that same browser answering and passed.
The law had nothing to say about the vault it guards, and the gate set published red=true, a red verdict nobody reached.

Now such a law raises a VenueFault (its message carries VENUE_MARK) once its launcher has given up, and run_gates reads a
gate whose EVERY unittest failure is a venue fault as VENUE: named apart from any red, and the set exits VENUE_EXIT (3)
when nothing was red - which the CI gate-set step publishes as reached=true, red=unknown (UNKNOWN: not a pass, not a red).
One failure of any other kind keeps the gate FAIL. The launcher's own retry and the browser laws' use of it are held by
tv/test_a_slow_browser_start_is_retried_and_named.py.

Driven: venue_only() over REAL unittest output (tiny unittest modules run in a subprocess, failing each way); the exit
rule; main()'s use of both, read at its lines; the CI step's real exit-code block cut from the workflow and run in bash
for exit 0, 1, 2 and 3. RED_PROOF below.
