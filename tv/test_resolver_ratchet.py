"""A NINTH RESOLVER MAY NOT APPEAR UNNOTICED.

⚠⚠ THIS GUARD EXISTS BECAUSE A COLD CROSS-FAMILY REVIEW PREDICTED EXACTLY HOW one_name DECAYS.
Asked how the design fails over a year, with no hint of this codebase's history:

    "The most likely decay path is new surfaces or new items appearing outside the concept table.
     Someone will add a fourth consumer (a log label, an export key, a UI label) and either
     hard-code another variant or extend the table inconsistently... the original resolvers
     continue to be patched directly because they are still the ones called in hot paths."

That is not hypothetical here. It has already happened FIVE times — A1's unreachable FLOWING, A3's
9 MISNAMED cells, the tab vocabulary, the duplicate board topics — and **I wrote two of those alias
maps myself, in one day, while fixing instances of the problem**. Nothing detected any of them; each
was found by tripping over the defect it caused, weeks or hours later.

So this is a RATCHET on resolvers: the census may FALL as they retire into one_name, and a NEW one
is a failure. Not because a local map is always wrong — sometimes it is genuinely local — but
because it must be a decision someone makes on purpose, in a diff, rather than the fifth accident.

⚠ IT ASSERTS THE CENSUS, NOT THE CODE. A file may hold whatever it needs; what may not happen is
the number quietly rising.
