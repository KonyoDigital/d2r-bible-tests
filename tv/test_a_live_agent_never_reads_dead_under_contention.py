"""#78 — A LIVE AGENT NEVER READS DEAD BECAUSE A LOCK WAS BUSY.

MEASURED 2026-09-29 in the v3523 pre-flight: test_button_matrix's SIM agent was up ("bridge up", "agent ping") and six
seconds later read DEAD ("reads grow or bridge stays: reads=0") - only under load, never alone (18 s green). The status
read asks `_agent_alive()`, which trusts the child handle only when it gets `_lock` quickly; otherwise it asks
`_pid_cached()`, whose 10 s port-scan cache could hold a None scanned while the agent was still booting. Nothing told
the cache the agent had started, so a live agent was 'off' until the cache aged out - the v872 "STANDBY keeps
jumping at me" shape, on his screen under game load.

DRIVEN: `_lock` held by another thread, a stale None planted in the cache, the real `_agent_alive()` asked. And every
place the console sets `_agent_proc` must tell the cache (parsed with ast, never grepped). RED_PROOF below.

REG-1510 (review of v3524) - three holes in the seed, each reproduced before it was fixed:
  * a status read refused the lock was ALREADY scanning when the spawn seeded, and wrote its older None over the seed.
    Driven with a real holder thread that seeds DURING the scan, the way start_agent/stop_agent seed while holding
    `_lock`; the stop's mirror starts from ts=0.0 so a `ts` compare-and-set cannot pass it (seed(None) writes 0.0 too).
    And the compare and the write must be one step: a seed preempting the read between them is driven as well.
  * a child we hold and whose poll() says it exited read ALIVE for the rest of the seed's 10 s. Driven with a handle
    that has exited, the lock free, and nothing on the port; plus a stranger on the port, which must still read alive.
  * the ast check saw only `_agent_proc = ...`. `globals()["_agent_proc"] = ...` (the form this file already uses for
    `_agent_mode` and `_capture_proc`) and `_agent_proc, _agent_mode = ...` were invisible to it. Driven on sources.
