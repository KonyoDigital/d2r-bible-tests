"""A LOCAL COMPANION APP BEING ABSENT ON A CLOUD RUNNER IS NOT A PRODUCT DEFECT.

`bible.html` probes the TV DIABLO console (127.0.0.1:17771/17772) to see whether it is running.
On a GitHub runner it never is, so every end-to-end audit recorded

    REQ: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED fetch http://127.0.0.1:17772/api/status

and scored **7/8 categories** — with `320/320 items opened · 0 fails · 0 page errors` printed
directly beside it. Routine G had therefore been RED on nothing but the absence of a desktop app,
across every run back to at least 2026-09-16 10:53.

`end_to_end_audit.js` already states the principle one line above the fix, about external hosts:
*"a gate that cries wolf gets ignored on the day it is right."* That is not a hypothetical here —
the swallowed-exception ratchet was correctly red for ten consecutive runs on three real defects
(REG-1034) and was walked past every time, because red had stopped meaning anything.

⚠ THE BUCKET IS NARROW ON PURPOSE AND STILL PRINTED. Only the console's two ports, only on
loopback. Any other local port still gates, because a probe to a port the page should not be
touching is a real finding. It prints on its own line as `CON:` with its own count and lands in
the JSON as `console_probe_failures` — recorded, not hidden. The difference between this and
suppression is that suppression makes the number disappear.

⚠ THIS GATE EXTRACTS THE REGEXES FROM THE AUDIT ITSELF rather than restating them. A test that
re-declares the pattern it is checking proves only that I can type it twice, and drifts silently
the moment the real one changes. [[copy-drift]] [[source-reading-guard]]
