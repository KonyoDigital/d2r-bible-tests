"""v2787 — THE SET PIECES CARRY A REAL QUALITY LEVEL, FROM THE GAME'S OWN TABLE.

Before this, 1,444 of 1,598 set-tier drop records carried `qlvl: 0`. A zero on a MISSING row is a
number he farms by — it says "any monster level can drop this" — and it was not measured, it was
absent. The qlvl check is one of the two filters that decide whether an item can drop at all
(`monster mlvl >= item qlvl`), so a wrong zero sends him to the wrong zone.

=== WHERE THE NUMBERS CAME FROM, AND WHY THE DATA IS NOT IN THIS REPO ===
Extracted from his local D2R CASC store: `data\\global\\excel\\setitems.txt`, column `lvl`,
joined on column `index`. Cross-checked against `data\\global\\excel\\base\\setitems.txt` —
132 pieces in both, ZERO disagreements. Full trace, hashes and the reproduction command are in
`SET_QLVL_PROVENANCE.md`. **The game table itself is Blizzard's and this repo is PUBLIC, so it is
deliberately absent** — which is exactly why the laws below pin the SHAPE of the data rather than
its values.

=== ⚠ THESE LAWS CANNOT COMPARE AGAINST THE SOURCE, SO THEY PIN WHAT THE SOURCE IMPLIES ===
Measured across all 35 sets in the game table: **every piece of a set carries the same qlvl, with
zero exceptions.** That is a property of the data that survives without the data. A partial or
corrupted fill breaks it immediately, and no Blizzard bytes are needed to check it.

=== ⚠ ELEVEN PIECES ARE STILL 0 AND THAT IS CORRECT ===
They have no row in the game table under any spelling. Some are probably NAMING ERRORS IN THE BIBLE
(the table says `Tal Rasha's Fire-Spun Cloth`, the bible says `Fine-Spun Cloth`), and a near-
spelling is not a trace. Guessing one would be the fabrication his rule forbids.
