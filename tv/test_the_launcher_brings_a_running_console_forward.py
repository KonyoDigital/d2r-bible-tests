"""REG-1514 — A DOUBLE-CLICK BRINGS A RUNNING CONSOLE FORWARD; IT REPLACES ONLY A STALE OR WINDOWLESS ONE.

The second eye on v3523's bg-service merge (4e22a57a, #231): start_tvd_mac.sh asked a console forward only when its
window was in the BACKGROUND; a window that was simply UP fell through to the soft-kill of :17772, so a Desktop
double-click replaced a healthy console - and any session it was filming. The kill exists for v1379.1 alone (never
window-only onto a STALE console), and the console says whether it is stale itself.

DRIVEN: tv/launcher_decide.decide() against a fake console on an EPHEMERAL port (never :17772) that answers
/api/window and /api/status the way the real one does, and records every POST. RED_PROOF below.
