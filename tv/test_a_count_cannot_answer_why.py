"""A COUNT CANNOT ANSWER "WHY", AND HE HAS ASKED THREE TIMES.

*"vault again is inporperly routing and stashing and vaulting 200+ items.. when it should be alot
less based on what we already established?"* — and later, at a screenshot of the Vault: *"stlll the
vault"*.

Every previous answer was a number. `vault_population()` decomposes it instead. MEASURED on his
board, 2026-09-17:

    owned 222 · filed to a locker 173 · setPieces 133

    uni-armor 68 · uni-weap 64 · sets-major 10 · sets-rest 9
    uni-small  9 · runewords 5 · shared      7 · __keep    1
    UNFILED   49

    of the 222 owned, 50 are ALSO in d2r_setPieces · 172 are not
    of the 49 unfiled, 31 are set pieces          · 18 are not

**172 is exactly his pre-wipe owned count.** So the 222 is 172 possessions plus 50 set pieces the
board also files as physical — one item in two stores, which is the board's own design (possession
versus the set chronicle) and not corruption. What makes the vault LOOK inflated is that 49 of them
are filed nowhere and land in the dock.

⚠ The locker figures match his screenshot exactly — uni-armor 68, uni-weap 64, sets-major 10,
sets-rest 9, uni-small 9, runewords 5. That correspondence is what makes this a reading of HIS
vault and not of a fixture. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]
