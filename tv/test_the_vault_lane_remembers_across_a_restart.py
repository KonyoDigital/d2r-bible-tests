"""WHAT THE VAULT LANE LEARNS MUST SURVIVE THE PROCESS — ESPECIALLY WHAT IT STOPPED PAYING FOR.

⚠⚠ MEASURED 2026-09-10 (#60, REG-900). `control_app._VAULT_AUTOREAD` had **14 write sites and ZERO
persistence sites** — no save, no load, no json anywhere. It held everything the lane had learned:

    reads    how many sweeps completed        tries    how many attempts each reel has cost
    lastTs   when the last one finished       retired  reels the lane STOPPED PAYING FOR

⚠ `retired` is the expensive one. A retirement is the lane's decision not to buy a reel again.
Losing it does not merely forget — it makes the lane pay a second time. That is the "and re-spends
for it" in #60's title, and it was a property of the code, not a suspicion.

⚠⚠ AND IT HAD BEEN LYING TO THE CORROBORATOR. `corroborate.py`'s `vault-lane-has-worked` reads
`lastTs or reads > 0` under the comment *"lastTs is the durable tell — `reads` is a process-local
counter and resets on every restart."* BOTH were process-local; there was no durable tell. That
false distinction is why a RESTART read as "this lane has never swept" — a very different
accusation from the truth, which was "this process is new". Measured on his tree the same day:
`on=True reads=0 lastTs=None owed=8`, while his console had been REPLACED TWICE in one hour (#67).
[[label-outlived-referent]] [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

⚠ NO FOOTAGE AND NO LIVE STORE. Every test here points TV_HIST at a temp directory, so it measures
the same thing on his Mac and on a CI runner — and it cannot touch the store his console is using.
