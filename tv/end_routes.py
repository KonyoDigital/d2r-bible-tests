"""THE END ROUTE — reverse-engineered from the 410 reels that actually reached it.

Konyo, 2026-09-06: *"it should be also eventually tombstoned though why is not also processed
through the printer to get routed back at the end routes they should. **reverse engineeer it if
needed the ones that are working** im saying like the end routes needs to still be like they are
working if they are working obviously."*

His sentence settles the DESTINATION and not the PREDICATE, and it names the method: derive the
door from the reels that already went through it. This module is that derivation. It invents
nothing — every clause below was read back off `reel_tombstones.json` joined to the three stores
that were live when those reels were removed.

=== WHAT THE 410 ACTUALLY HAVE IN COMMON (measured 2026-09-06, his tree) ================

    410 rows in the ledger · 5,768.1 MB · deleted 2026-08-24 -> 2026-09-01

    STRUCTURAL door   retro_triage[reel].full is True AND panels == 0      396   1,792.0 MB
    SEMANTIC door     chronicle pages >= 1 AND the vault lane is settled    11   3,880.0 MB
    SEMANTIC, vault unconfirmable (pages 71 and 35, no seal, reel gone)      2      96.1 MB
    UNEXPLAINED                                                              1       9.5 MB

⚠⚠ SO THE DOOR THAT CARRIED 96.6% OF ALL END-ROUTE TRAFFIC IS **"THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO READ"**,
NOT "IT WAS READ". Of the 396 that went structural: **394 had `pages: 0`**, **392 had no vault seal
at all**, and **54 had no chronicle row whatsoever**. They were never read and never sealed. The
FREE structural pass surveyed every frame and found no panel on any of them, so there was nothing
for either lane to take.

⚠⚠ AND THE PERMANENT RECORD OF THAT IRREVERSIBLE ACT SAYS THE OPPOSITE. All 410 tombstones carry
`why: "read (N pages) and sealed by BOTH lanes — it has given up its information"`, written by
`reel_retention.plan()`'s single `eligible` branch. For 395 of them BOTH clauses are false. The
sentence describes the door the author had in mind, not the door the reel came through, and it is
the only record left of footage that has no un-delete. [[label-outlived-referent]]
`derived_from()` publishes that contradiction as a number rather than leaving it in prose.

=== WHY THIS IS A DISJUNCTION AND MUST STAY ONE ==========================================

Either door alone is sufficient. Conjoining them is not a stricter version of the same rule — it
is a different rule that has never once been satisfied: **392 of the 396 structural releases have
no vault seal**, so an AND would have refused 96% of every end-route journey that has ever
happened. That is the same collapse v2312 attempted on the reel/frame doors and WITHDREW at v2314.
[[feedback-contradiction-is-the-finding]]

=== WHAT THIS MODULE DECIDES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT ======================================

It answers ONE question: **has this reel got anything left to give?** That is the CONTENT half.

It does NOT decide deletion. `reel_retention.plan()` owns the SAFETY ladder above it —
no-witness-index, ledger-unreadable, test-fixture, recent — and a reel can be QUALIFIED here and
correctly held there. Keeping the two apart is the whole point of his ruling: a reel held because
the suite opens it by name has NOT dead-ended, and a reel held because 123 unread stash panels sit
in it HAS. Today those two states are indistinguishable on every surface, because both just read
"not eligible". `report()` prints them as different columns.

**IT DELETES NOTHING, WRITES NOTHING, AND ARMS NOTHING.** The prune stays off by his 2026-09-02
ruling; this is a reader.

=== THE VALUABLE HALF: WHAT SPECIFICALLY IS MISSING ======================================

Every refusal names the artifact, the measured value and the needed value. A gap nobody has
measured carries `measured: None` and says so — `0` is measured-and-zero, `None` is nobody looked,
and this module never collapses them. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
