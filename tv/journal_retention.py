"""WHAT MAY LEAVE THE JOURNAL, AND WHY EVERY OTHER ROW STAYS. Writes nothing.

Konyo, 2026-09-13: *"it should all go through the river and end up in tombstone and then in
deleted after being extracted"*, and *"should be left with last 8 sessions/reels"*.

⚠⚠ THE REEL RIVER IS ALREADY FINISHED, AND THIS IS THE HALF THAT IS NOT. Measured 2026-09-13:
20 reels on disk, `ROUTED 20` — every one routed, which reel_router's own note calls "the REAL
tombstone" — and `TOMBSTONE 0`, which means none have LEFT THE DISK. That zero is CORRECT: the 20
are 8 he asked to keep + 9 the test suite pins + 3 still held, and retention refuses all three
groups for good reasons. There is nothing left for the REEL planner to release.

His shelf still shows **419 rows**, because the shelf lists JOURNAL sessions and a row outlives its
film. 2,893 journaled · 2,474 hidden as empty · 419 shown · **20 reels**. Roughly 195 of the shown
rows name film that no longer exists.

⚠⚠⚠ AND THIS MODULE DELETES NOTHING. `plan()` classifies and explains, exactly as
`reel_retention.plan()` does — "what may go, oldest first, and WHY every other reel stays. Writes
nothing." A journal row is his record of a night he played. The apply half is a separate decision
and it is HIS.

THE EXTRACTION RULE, and it is deliberately strict:

    RELEASABLE   footageState == "retired" — the film gave up its information and was THEN
                 released. That is the system's own proof that extraction happened, produced by
                 the retention lane, not by this module guessing.
    HELD         everything else, including rows with no film at all. "No film" is not "extracted";
                 it is an absence of evidence either way. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

⚠ FOUR THINGS ARE NEVER RELEASABLE, whatever the state says:
    · the newest KEEP_RECENT sessions — his own number, and reel_retention already uses 8
    · any row whose reel still has film on disk — the river has not finished with it
    · any row whose reel the TEST SUITE opens by name — deleting one turns a real check into a
      permanent skip, which has already happened three times
    · any row that cannot be dated, because "newest 8" is meaningless without an order

    ⚠⚠ v3109 — THE THIRD ARTEFACT, AND THE FIRST ONE THAT ACTUALLY HOLDS THESE FIELDS. This asked
    `chronicle_swept.json` twice and both readings were wrong about the same thing:

        v3105  key present          -> "the reel was READ"        (a look, not a bank)
        v3107  pages >= 1           -> "the reel yielded pages"   (CHRONICLE pages, not these fields)

    A cross-family read of v3107 named the remaining hole exactly: `pages` counts chronicle pages
    landing in the EVIDENCE ledger, and `_PAYLOAD_FIELDS` — finds, tallies, intakes, named, chron,
    registered, judged, topFind — are not in `chronicle_swept.json` at all. A session can drop a
    Shako into the journal row AND have a Chronicle panel that banked a page: `pages >= 1` releases
    the row, and the sweep file still does not contain the Shako.

    So this reads the place those finds are ACTUALLY written: `chron_evidence.json`, whose
    `uniques`/`sets` entries carry per-sighting rows `{reel, frame, witness, conf, lane}`.
    MEASURED on his tree: it cites 29 distinct reels, and all 12 of the payload-carrying rows the
    planner would release are among them — so today the answer is unchanged and the MECHANISM is
    finally the right one, which is what matters when the two stop coinciding.

    ⚠⚠ BOTH SPELLINGS. control_app's v2800 scar measured this exact file: 4,106 witness rows carry
    `reel_`-prefixed ids and 4,411 carry BARE ones — a near 50/50 split of two conventions in one
    field — and "every lookup whose spelling did not match its directory reported the photo as
    ABSENT". A walker that accepts one spelling under-counts the bank and holds rows that are
    safe; on the other side of a different rule it would RELEASE rows that are not.
