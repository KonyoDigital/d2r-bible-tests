"""v2799 — THE LIVE FRAME WAS STAT-ED IN ONE PLACE AND OPENED IN ANOTHER, AND THE CAPTURE MOVES IT.

⚠⚠ WHAT IT COST, 2026-09-08. He pressed MINI AUTO and it refused. The reason, once v2798's toast
finally made refusals visible where he was standing:

    "the grid could not be located on this frame: unreadable:
     [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '.../tv/frames/eye…'"

`_mini_cells_from_live_frame` picked the newest EXISTING label out of
(eye.jpg, live.jpg, live.png, live.bmp) with `os.path.isfile`, then handed the PATH to
`vault_corpus.inventory_lattice()`, which opens it LATER. The capture promotes eye.jpg by replacing
it, so between the stat and that open there is a window where the file does not exist.

That is why MINI AUTO alternated between two different complaints — "the newest frame is Ns old"
and "the grid could not be located" — depending purely on whether a promote was in flight. Two
faces of ONE missing file. MEASURED with no capture running: eye.jpg ABSENT, live.jpg present and
274s old; with a capture running, eye.jpg exists and is newest, and the race is live.

=== ⛔ WHY READING THE BYTES WAS NOT ENOUGH, AND I NEARLY SHIPPED THAT ===
My first cut read the bytes here and then passed the PATH onward anyway — plumbing with no tap. The
read would prove the file existed a moment ago and the readers would still race it. Checked and
confirmed: `inventory_lattice(frame_path)` and `inventory_occupancy(frame_path, lat)` BOTH open what
they are given and neither accepts bytes. So the bytes are written to a private snapshot and the
SNAPSHOT is what travels. [[the-unjoined-end]]

=== ⚠ NOT A WIDER AGE BOUND ===
The obvious "fix" is to relax the 10s freshness rule. That would be treating a race as slowness: the
file's ABSENCE was the event, never its age, and widening the bound would have hidden it for good.
