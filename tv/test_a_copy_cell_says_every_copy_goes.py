"""#111 (reviewers C2/E/D) - A COPY CELL'S X SAYS EVERY COPY GOES.

The X on ONE copy's cell called vaultUnassign(name) - every copy of the item went back to the dock - and its hover said only
"send back to the unsorted dock". Copies of one item share one filing (d2r_muleAssign is per name; #76's per-copy record
store is still dormant), so one copy cannot leave alone yet: on a cell whose item has more than one copy, the X says so.
A single copy, a hardened lock and an unreadable lock store read as before.

Driven on the whole page in node (window._vaultCellXTitle), and the cell paints its X through it. RED_PROOF below.
