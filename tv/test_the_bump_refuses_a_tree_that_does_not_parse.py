"""THE VERSION STAMP IS THE MOMENT THE TREE BECOMES SOMETHING HE EXECUTES, SO IT MUST PARSE FIRST.

⚠⚠ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE I PUT A SyntaxError ON HIS LIVE SCREEN THROUGH THIS EXACT DOOR.
2026-09-14: a splice in bible.html used `} catch(e){}` as its END anchor and left it behind, so the
file carried a bare catch closing nothing. I then ran `bump_version.py`, which cheerfully stamped
v3100 onto a file the browser refuses to parse — and HIS CONSOLE EXECS THE WORKING TREE, so
`window.renderSubMeter` was never assigned on his screen until the second eye found it on the
shipped diff.

**The gate that catches this already existed.** `js-syntax` is registered in run_gates and parses
every surface in a real engine. I ran `visual_lock_invariant` after the edit — because that is what
had refused the push — and not the one that asks whether the file still parses. A law nobody runs
is a law nobody applied, and no amount of adding laws fixes that.
[[carved-skill-unloaded-is-unapplied]] [[execs-the-working-tree]]

⚠ SO THE CHECK MOVED TO THE CHOKE POINT INSTEAD. Every change passes through the version bump — the
four stamps move together or none do — and the block there already promised *"nothing touches disk
until all four are known good"*. Until v3103 "known good" meant only that a regex matched. Parsing
is what that sentence was always claiming. [[the-unjoined-end]]

⚠ AND IT PARSES THE ONE LINE THE TOOL ITSELF WRITES. `note` is free text landing inside a
single-quoted JS string literal. Two guards above it refuse an apostrophe and a callable CSS token
— the two spellings that have actually bitten — but neither is a parser, and a guard list of past
accidents does not cover the next one.
