"""Copy this repo somewhere scratch WITHOUT the things that will fill his disk.

⚠⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS, MEASURED. On 2026-09-03 three review agents were each told, in my own workflow
prompt, to "work on COPIES under /tmp if you need to sabotage something". Each ran

    cp -R /Users/konyo/d2r_bible_tests/tv /tmp/skep_<n>/tv

`tv/` holds the reel JPEG store (5.8 GB) and, at the time, a Chrome profile the render gate never
cleaned (1.4 GB). Three copies wrote **20.5 GB in four minutes** onto a volume with about 9 GB
free. It hit ENOSPC, and then every Bash call in the session — mine and every agent's — failed
before it ran, because the harness could not create its own output file. Nobody could even run
`df` to see what had happened, let alone `rm`.

The prompt was the defect. "Copy it to /tmp" is a reasonable instruction that happens to be
catastrophic in a repo carrying gigabytes of footage, and no amount of remembering fixes that.
So: a copier that CANNOT carry the heavy directories, and REFUSES rather than filling the disk.

    python3 tv/safe_copy.py /tmp/my_scratch          # the whole repo, minus the heavy parts
    python3 tv/safe_copy.py /tmp/my_scratch tv       # just tv/, same exclusions

⚠ IT IS NOT A GENERAL COPIER AND MUST NOT BECOME ONE. It has one job: make the copy a sabotage
test needs, which is source and config, never footage.
