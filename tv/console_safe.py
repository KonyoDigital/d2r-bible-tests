"""v1480 — one place that makes a script's OUTPUT survive the operator's console.

Why this module exists
----------------------
This has now been the same bug three times:

  REG-044  tv_diablo needed a win32 stdio reconfigure to print its own status lines.
  REG-054  both test suites were only ever green because PYTHONIOENCODING was set by hand
           off-screen; a plain run went red AND corrupted a tracked fixture.
  REG-077  visual_lock_invariant and js_syntax_gate each PASSED their check, reached the success
           branch, and died inside print("✅ …") -> exit 1 on a clean tree.

The machine this ships on has a Hebrew console (cp1255), which cannot encode the check marks,
arrows and box characters the tooling prints everywhere. The failure is always the same shape and
always in the dangerous direction: a correct tree reports FAILURE, which trains people to ignore
the tool, and then the next real failure is ignored too.

A gate that cannot REPORT is a broken gate. Its verdict must depend on the code under test, never
on the shell that happened to launch it.

Usage
-----
    from console_safe import enable
    enable()          # first thing in main(), before anything prints

`errors="replace"` rather than a strict encoder: a character we failed to anticipate should cost a
question mark in the output, never the verdict.

    UTF-8 capable, False if any could not be reconfigured (an old file object, a redirect to a
    non-text stream), so a caller that cares can degrade its own output instead of guessing.

# ══ v3293 — THE AUDIT LIVES BESIDE THE FIX ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
# test_control has carried this rule for a long time and it WORKS — it refused three files in tv/
# on their first run (lane_census.py, rung_accounting_wilson.py, render_check.py each say so in a
# comment) and it refused one of mine this session. The defect is not the rule, it is WHEN you
# learn: it sits inside a ~500s suite that runs at push time, which is the most expensive moment
# to discover a missing one-line import.
#
# So the rule moves HERE, next to the enable() it tells you to call, and test_control calls this
# instead of keeping its own copy. One definition, three callers (the suite, the CLI, the hook) —
# a second copy of a rule is how two rules start disagreeing. [[copy-drift]]
