"""REG-2963 (#161 stage 2, his go 2026-10-21) - THE PUSH PROVES BROWSER LAWS ON GITHUB, AND NEVER NOWHERE.

Before: hooks/pre-push proved every changed law at push time with heart2 --prove --push, browser laws included - one
at a time, ~30 minutes of the v3833 push. Now, BEFORE its proving stage, the hook asks tv/proof_keys_mac.py --split:

  * a changed law that starts a browser (heart2._push_browser: the run's own lock rule) goes to the CI proof job - but
    only when the push ships to main AND publish.yml's deploy waits for that job (proof_gate reads both workflow files:
    Publish's job calls proof-keys-shards.yml with gate deploy, the deploy needs it, the shard workflow takes the call);
  * a law only the Mac can prove (a need a runner lacks, a PROOF_NEEDS git does not track - local_gates), every
    non-browser law, and EVERY law of a push that does not ship to main or of a tree whose gate is not wired, is proved
    on the Mac;
  * each changed law lands in exactly one venue, the ones left to CI are NAMED ("the CI proof job proves N browser
    law(s); the deploy waits for it"), and a split that cannot be decided proves everything on the Mac.

The hook's own block is run in bash against the real tv/proof_keys_mac.py (the joint), with fixture refs. RED_PROOF below.
