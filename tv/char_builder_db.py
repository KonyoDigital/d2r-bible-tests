"""#174 v-B2 — THE CHARACTER BUILDER'S ITEM DATABASE, TAKEN FROM HIS OWN INSTALL, WRITTEN INTO THE BOARD.

His words: "if i click on helmet lets say.. it shold give me the options from the entire database to put as a
helmet or runeword and based on the base item.. exactly like the d2r one to one". The board had no such database:
ITEM_CODEX holds 320 names and ITEM_TIP 301, while the game he plays (Reign of the Warlock) has ~440 uniques, 140
set items, 181 runewords, every crafted recipe and every base. A picker that offered only what the board happened
to have typed would be a picker that lies by omission.

So this file pulls the game's own excel tables and display strings from the CASC of the install on this machine
(the same `_pull` tv/item_tables.py and tv/mule_slot_map.py use), and writes ONE generated JSON block into
bible.html between two markers:

    python3 tv/char_builder_db.py            # --check: is the block in bible.html what the install says?
    python3 tv/char_builder_db.py --write    # regenerate it (atomic, honours bible.html.EDIT_LOCK)

WHAT IS IN IT, AND WHERE EACH FACT COMES FROM
  · cls   the classes, in charstats.txt order (the game's class index), with the strings the game prints for
          "+N to <Class> Skill Levels", the three skill tabs and "(<Class> Only)"
  · ty    every item type the doll or the inventory can hold: its UI category (itemtypes.txt `UICategory`, the
          game's own grouping — pelts are `druid`, primal helms `barbh`), the class that alone may use it
          (`Class` through the `Equiv` chain) and its socket ceiling by item level (`MaxSockets1..3` with
          their level thresholds)
  · rail  per doll slot, which UI categories it takes — the slot's "base categories" the picker's left rail lists
  · b     every base: display name (item-names.json), type, tier and its normal/exceptional/elite family
          (`normcode`/`ubercode`/`ultracode`), sockets (`gemsockets`), requirements, defense or damage, which
          hands it needs (weapons.txt `2handed`/`1or2handed`), its inventory size, whether it can be ethereal
          (it has durability — an item with none cannot be)
  · it    every unique (uniqueitems.txt, the disabled ones left out), set item (setitems.txt), runeword
          (runes.txt `complete` = 1, with the item types it may be made in and the ones excluded) and crafted
          recipe (cubemain.txt rows that output a crafted item), each with its PROPERTY LINES rendered from the
          game's own words: properties.txt maps a property to its stats, itemstatcost.txt says how each stat is
          described (`descfunc` / `descstrpos` / `descpriority`), and item-modifiers.json holds the text — "All
          Resistances %+d", "%d%% Chance to cast level %d %s on striking". A rolled value is a RANGE the page
          draws as a box; a fixed one is a number.
  · sk    what fits a socket: every rune and gem (gems.txt: its weapon / helm-and-armor / shield modifiers)
  · T     the line templates, stored once and referenced by index (the block is ~40% smaller for it)
  · af    #174 v-B3 — every SPAWNABLE magicprefix / magicsuffix / automagic row: its display name
          (item-nameaffixes.json), level / maxlevel / levelreq, the rare flag, its group, the class it is tied to
          (`classspecific`), its item types and excluded types, its lines (roll keys m1..m3 = its mod columns) and its
          frequency — the ADD MOD list of the Edit tab, filtered on the page by the base's types, the item level, the
          groups already used, the rare flag and the quality's limits. A base's automagic group is its b[22]
          (`auto prefix`), its `magic lvl` its b[23] (the page holds an affix's level against the AFFIX level
          alvl, from the item level, qlvl b[18] and magic lvl - never the item level itself). An affix's [13] is
          its class level requirement (`class` / `classlevelreq`: of Magic Arrows 11, an Amazon 1). A charged
          skill whose table values are NEGATIVE (all 112 "of <Skill>" charges) is set by the item level in the
          game's code: an UNKNOWN line ("Level ? Magic Arrow (?/? Charges)"), never "Level -10".
  · rn    the rare name words (rareprefix / raresuffix), each with the item types it may name and whether a string
          table names it (a key no table names would be kept, flagged 0, never offered as a name). The game asks
          EVERY string table: six words are named only by monsters.json (GhoulRI "Ghoul", Wraithra "Wraith",
          Fiendra "Fiend", crusher "Crusher", scarab "Scarab") and ui.json (strap "Strap") - #174 v-B3 fix round
  · qm    a superior item's modifiers (qualityitems.txt rows and the columns they apply to), the low-quality words
          (lowqualityitems.txt), which qualityitems column each item type reads, and which qualities each type may
          drop in (itemtypes.txt Normal / Magic / Rare, the type's OWN flags)

  · #174 v-B4 — THE IN-GAME TOOLTIP, TRUE TO THE TABLES (APPENDED, nothing reordered):
          b[24] weapons.txt `speed`, b[25] the base's durability (0 = none to print), b[26] / b[27] `wclass` /
          `2handedwclass`; ty[t][5] the "<Class> Class - %s" string key its weapons print (WCLASS_KEY, "" = no table
          names one); it[8] 1 when the item's own properties change its durability; cls[i].tok its plrtype.txt Token;
          TK — aligned with T, each template's [descpriority, descfunc, stat id, several-stats] (one template is one
          stat's words: the page merges a runeword's lines with its runes' and orders them by it); tip — the tooltip's
          own strings by key (Durability / Required ... / Defense / One-Hand / Two-Hand Damage / Socketed / Charmdes /
          RuneQuote / WeaponDesc* / WeaponAttack*), each rune's short name (r26L "Vex"), every class's Attack1 frames
          and rate per weapon class (animdata.d2) and the stat ids the tooltip reads lines by. all-stats (one roll, four
          stats = itemstatcost dgrp 1) prints the group's own "+N to all Attributes", once.
          Fix round: tip.dg - the game's stat groups (itemstatcost dgrp: the group line's template and each member's
          stat id and templates), so the page prints a group's one line only when every member is on the item and all
          are equal (Duress: Cold Resist +45% and three +15%, never "All Resistances +15" beside "Cold Resist +30%");
          tip.st.poisonmindam - two poison sources are one stat, combined by the game's code (the page says UNKNOWN).

A ROLL'S KEY IS THE GAME'S. Each rolled value carries the column it comes from — `p3` is uniqueitems.txt
prop3 / setitems.txt prop3 / runes.txt T1Code3 / cubemain.txt `mod 3`, `a2b` a set item's aprop2b. The builder
stores a typed roll under that key (d2r_charBuilds ...slots[slot].rolls = {p3: 25}), so the stats engine, which
reads the same tables, can join a typed roll to the property it belongs to without parsing any text.

⚠ WHAT IS NOT HERE, SAID RATHER THAN FILLED: a property the tables name but do not describe (RotW's sunder-charm
affix groups, a few commented-out rows) becomes an UNKNOWN line naming its code — never dropped, never guessed.
A monster a reanimate property names is its id, not its name (monstats is not read). A magic jewel's or a
crafted item's RANDOM affixes are not listed: only what the recipe guarantees.

⚠ NO INSTALL = UNKNOWN (exit 77), never "the block is fine". The block is still checked in CI without one:
test_the_character_builder_is_their_builder.py proves every base, unique, set item and runeword name in it is
the name the committed tv/item_tables.json carries for it. [[unknown-stays-unknown]] [[copy-drift]]
