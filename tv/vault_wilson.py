"""A2 · can the VAULT APPLY refuse when it must? — and why vault.forget cannot be proven this way.

`vault.apply` guards "mules items between characters": the door that WRITES HIS LEDGER. Its bar is
0.722 and it sat UNPROVEN at n=0 because nothing was permitted to feed it.

⚠⚠ THIS HARNESS NEVER APPLIES ANYTHING. Every attempt is a proposal the door MUST reject, and each
one is rejected at the re-gate — v1595's check — which returns BEFORE the board is ever asked. The
only thing counted is whether it refused. There is no attempt here whose success path runs.

⚠ THE ROWS ARE BUILT TO FAIL. Each carries an EMPTY evidence list, so `vault_retro.gate()` refuses
it on witnesses alone. A row that might pass would be a row that might be written into his stash,
and that is not a risk a test may take. [[feedback-fixtures-never-touch-live-data]]

⚠⚠ AND THE FINDING THAT COMES WITH IT: `vault.forget` CANNOT BE PROVEN THIS WAY AT ALL. Measured by
AST — 7 lines, one return, and ZERO refusal paths. It clears the swept memory and always answers
ok. Its own docstring explains why that is correct: "an optimisation he cannot clear is a cage",
and the ledger is rebuildable from the reels. So there is no wrong input for it to catch, and its
lock will sit UNPROVEN forever — not because nobody tried, but because there is nothing to try.
That is a fact about the door, not a gap in the evidence, and inventing a sabotage for it would be
manufacturing proof. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

# ══ v3067 — FOUR ATTACKS DESIGNED BY A DIFFERENT MODEL FAMILY ═══════════════════════════════
# `vault_apply` was handed COLD — comments stripped, no premise — to the third eye, the same
# method that found the `unsure` hole in v2641. It returned five payloads and had run them.
# FOUR of the five were LIVE against the shipped code; every one is now refused.
#
# ⚠ THESE ARE FOUR DISTINCT MECHANISMS, NOT ONE IDEA IN FOUR COATS, and that distinction is the
# whole arithmetic: self_arming scores on wilson_lower(min(k, attacks), attacks), so looping one
# attack buys nothing. They fail at four different joints — the container, the row, the type
# check, and an ungated lane.
# ⚠ NOTHING REACHES HIS LEDGER. Each attempt runs with the board eval stubbed, and a refusal
# never reaches the window at all.

    the function; that is a sabotage, and sabotage is one kind of evidence. vault.apply carries
    kinds_bar 1.3 precisely so that one kind cannot open it — "Wilson counts how many looks agreed,
    never whether they were independent". Asking the LIVE console, over the wire, through the route
    his own UI posts to, is a genuinely different witness: it exercises the routing, the JSON body
    handling and the running process, none of which an import touches.

    ⚠ IT IS STILL THE SAFE ATTEMPT. Every row carries an empty evidence list, so the re-gate
    rejects the proposal before the board is asked. Verified with ONE request before any batch was
    sent: ok False, and the response NAMES the rejected row.

    ⚠ AN UNREACHABLE CONSOLE BANKS NOTHING. Returns None, which the caller reports as UNKNOWN —
