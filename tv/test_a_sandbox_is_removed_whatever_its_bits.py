"""REG-1746 — A PROVER SANDBOX IS REMOVED WHATEVER ITS PERMISSION BITS, AND "REMOVED" MEANS THE PATH IS GONE.

MEASURED on the ALT, 2026-10-02: 72 heart2.* sandboxes in its TEMP since 09-29 - 20,345 MB, with 25.8 GB free.
Each held the three files of a git pack, ~280 MB: git writes packs READ-ONLY, Windows refuses to unlink a
read-only file ("[WinError 5] Access is denied"), and every removal was rmtree(ignore_errors=True). The drop
deleted the owner file first, so the stale sweep read each leftover as ownerless and then failed on the same pack.
The sweep's own run removed 1 of 29 sandboxes older than a day - the one that still had its owner file and no pack.

  · DRIVEN: a planted sandbox whose bits block a plain rmtree (a read-only file for Windows, a read-only directory
    for POSIX - the same failure on each machine) is removed by the drop, by the stale sweep, and by the helper.
  · BASELINE first: a plain rmtree(ignore_errors=True) must LEAVE the planted tree, or the case cannot tell the two
    apart (running as an administrator/root, permissions do not bind - then it says so and skips).
  · DRIVEN: the helper's answer is whether the path still exists, and a drop that still fails says so on stderr.
