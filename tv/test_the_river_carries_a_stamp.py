"""THE RIVER REMEMBERS — the gate on `river_stamp`, the only module in the family that WRITES.

MEASURED before this store existed. `reel_router.route()` answers where all 40 reels are, on every
call, and remembers nothing: `grep -rln river_stamp tv/` -> nothing, and no file in the tree held a
per-reel per-station history. So the console could say a reel was at CAPTURE and could not say
whether it had been there ten minutes or since July. His ask was the journey — *"synced from
station and down to tombstone"* — and the journey had no store.

=== WHY EACH LAW BELOW IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS ===

1. APPEND-ONLY IS CHECKED BY AST, NOT BY PROMISE. A docstring saying "append-only" is a sentence;
   the file mode is the fact. `open(p, "w")` truncates BEFORE anything is computed and has already
   destroyed a multi-megabyte file in this tree once — here it would destroy every journey. The
   law walks the module's own AST for an open() whose mode contains "w", and separately requires
   the append call to exist and be REACHABLE. Text presence is not reachability: an append sitting
   under `if False:` leaves every string a grep looks for exactly where it was.

2. THE DEDUPE IS ON THE CURRENT STATION, AND THE RE-ENTRY LAW IS WHAT MAKES THAT TESTABLE. "Do not
   duplicate a row" has two readings and only one is honest. Global — one row per (reel, station)
   ever — silently erases every regression, and a regression is the most interesting thing a
   journey can hold; `reel_router.OWES["EMPTY"]` already documents that its verdict is REOPENABLE,
   so re-entry is a state this river is built to produce. So BOTH halves are pinned: a repeated
   stamp writes nothing, and a genuine return writes a row.

3. ORDER IS APPEND ORDER, AND THE LAW PROVES IT IS NOT A SORT. A row written with an `at` in the
   past must stay LAST. If `history()` ever sorted by the clock, two stamps in one millisecond or
   one clock step backwards would silently reorder a reel's life. The contradiction is published
   (`outOfOrder`) rather than resolved.

4. UNKNOWN IS THREE DIFFERENT FACTS AND NONE OF THEM IS ZERO — the store missing (measured, never
   stamped), the store unreadable (nobody could look), and a reel with no row (never walked). A
   census that answered `0` for the middle one would let a broken store read as a fresh shelf, and
   `stamp()` would then write a duplicate for every reel on it.

⚠ THIS SUITE NEVER TOUCHES THE LIVE STORE. Every write goes to a tempdir passed as `path=`, and the
last law fingerprints `tv/river_stamp.jsonl` before and after to prove it.
