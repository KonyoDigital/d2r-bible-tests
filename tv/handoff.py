"""Drain a handoff queue in O(new), not O(all) — and never lose a brief to a watermark.

Measured 2026-09-18, the reason this exists: issue #180 held 1,177 comments / 2.55 MB, and 140
comments (536 KB) arrived in one day against 10 replies. `gh issue view --comments` fetches the
WHOLE history to show the newest, so every drain paid 2.55 MB to read 6 new briefs. A queue that
expensive to read stops being read, which is exactly what happened.

This reads only what arrived since the last watermark, using the REST `since` parameter, and it
sorts the ASK / ACT lines to the top because the old format buried them under the evidence.

⚠ THE WATERMARK MOVES ONLY WHEN YOU SAY SO (`--mark`). Draining does NOT advance it. A drain that
silently marked-as-read would lose every brief that arrived while the reader was mid-answer, and an
unanswered brief that no longer appears is worse than a noisy queue — it is a queue that lies.
