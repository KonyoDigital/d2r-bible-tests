"""REG-2522 FIX ROUND (V1 round 3; the review of REG-2522, major) - A ROSTER THIS BOARD WROTE IS READ, HIS MULES KEPT, AND A
ROSTER THAT IS HELD COMES BACK WITH HIS MULES, NEVER RENAMED TO THEIR IDS.

REG-2522 quarantined every saved roster that lacked a DEFAULT_ROSTER locker and told him "every roster this board saves holds
them, so these bytes did not come from it". False: until REG-2195 (2026-10-14, b32f373f2) every locker but SHARED STASH had
a 🗑, and vaultDeleteMule saved the roster without it. Reviewer, on the track head (p1 / p1b): the ten core lockers without
'wip' plus his mule {id:'m1k9zq2x', name:'WAR-1', added, boundChar:'Konyo'} -> quarantined, the whole vault held (every
register, vaultFile, the sorter, removals and + Add refused), the page drawing the 11 default lockers with WAR-1 gone; and
Start it fresh rebuilt the roster from the map's mule ids alone - WAR-1 came back as 'M1K9ZQ2X' (name, icon, note,
boundChar lost) and PVP-2, an added mule with no filing, was dropped.

NOW (bible.html ⟦VAULT HOLD⟧ and the migrations after it):
  * a core locker his roster lacks comes back at its default place, the v404 / v342.5 / v360 way, his own mules and notes
    kept and the roster saved - the vault is not held;
  * a roster is held only when the mule map still files items to a mule it lacks (_rosterMapWhy - the prune would drop
    them; the delete door takes a mule's filings with it), and while held the page shows his mules, rebuilt over the
    roster's own bytes and written nowhere;
  * Start it fresh rebuilds over the bytes kept aside (_vaultRosterFresh(raw)): every mule they list verbatim, every core
    locker, a stand-in for each mule the map names that they do not;
  * nothing saved yet + a map that files items to mules the default roster lacks: a stand-in for each, saved, no filing
    pruned (there are no bytes to keep aside).
The empty roster "[]" and another tab's write stay the REG-2522 law's (test_a_roster_without_its_core_lockers_is_unknown).

WHAT IS DRIVEN: the store door, the boot and its notice (Start it fresh), the tab sync, the vault module's head (load, the
hold, every migration), the shipped saveA / saveR and the W6 prune, cut from bible.html, in node. RED_PROOF below. A
missing node is the only skip.
