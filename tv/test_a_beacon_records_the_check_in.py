"""v3390 (#135) - A BEACON RECORDS THE CHECK-IN, NOT ONLY THE CHANGE.

Konyo, 2026-09-20, answering the one question I had left open: Dean was ON THE CONSOLE, not the
website. That retired my own retraction - there IS a beacon defect, and I had written it off.

functions/api/console.js wrote the durable last-seen key only on a material change:

    if (material) { await kv.put('lastseen:' + machine, ...) }
    else          { skipped.push('lastseen (nothing changed)') }

`material` covers ver / mode / event / diskVer / tally / masks / pull / eye.live. A console that
is OPEN and beaconing every ~4 minutes with none of those moving never refreshed it, so its
"last seen" was the last time something CHANGED. Dean idles without ticking items, so his row
froze hardest precisely because he is the least busy user - the whole 26 hours Konyo questioned.

REPRODUCED against the real handler before any fix was written:
    beacon 1 (first ever)   stored: ["console","lastseen"]
    beacon 2 (IDLE, same)   stored: []            <- checked in, left no trace
    beacon 3 (he ticked 1)  stored: ["console","lastseen"]

⚠ SHARPER THAN A FROZEN NUMBER. `console:` refreshes on a timer (`material || ageS >= REFRESH_S`);
only `lastseen:` had none. During a long idle session the machine reads ONLINE with a stale
last-seen, and the moment presence expires the offline list prints that stale stamp instead of
the session that just ended. That is exactly what he saw.

⚠⚠ THREE ARTEFACTS DISAGREED AND THE CODE WAS THE ODD ONE OUT:
  * the file header: "lastseen: - DURABLE last check-in, TTL 400d, written on EVERY beacon
    INCLUDING heartbeats" - which I read, believed, and repeated to him as proof his beacon was
    healthy. A comment describing a rule the adjacent code does not implement is worse than no
    comment: it convinced the reader the case was handled. [[measured-true-read-wrong]]
  * the budget sizing REFRESH_S: "4 x (3600/900) x 24 x 2 = 768 writes/day" - the x 2 is BOTH
    keys at the 15-minute cadence, so the fix costs nothing that was not already budgeted.
  * the code.

⚠ ANCHORING NOTE FOR ANY FUTURE SABOTAGE: after the fix, `if (material || ageS >= REFRESH_S) {`
appears TWICE - once for `console:` and once for `lastseen:`. An anchor on that line alone
matches 2 and must include the `kv.put` line beneath it. PRINT THE MATCH COUNT.
[[regression-guard]] 5a

WHAT THIS FILE PINS - behaviour, by running the REAL Cloudflare handler against a stub KV that
persists across beacons (run_handler builds a fresh store per call, so this file keeps its own):
  * an idle repeat beacon PAST REFRESH_S refreshes lastseen - the defect itself
  * an idle repeat beacon INSIDE REFRESH_S does NOT - the write budget still holds
  * a material change writes at ANY age - the BASELINE, without which a fix that wrote every
    time would pass the first case and cost him the KV ceiling
  * a first-ever beacon writes both keys - a cold console is not a repeat
