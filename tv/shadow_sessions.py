"""#218 (his ruling 2026-10-28, phase 1) - THE OWNER'S SESSIONS, SUMMARIZED SO A SHADOW CAN SHOW THEM.

His words: a shadow must render the owner's exact data one to one - and his ruling on the size: summarized frames, "a
few small key frames per session", because a full reel is 8-12 GB and never leaves its PC (his 10-07 ruling stands).
In a shadow today THE SHELF answers with a refusal toast and TV·D shows the viewer's own pane: the owner's sessions are
not in the upload (console_snapshot DENY keeps tvdHist and the session log home, on purpose - they are large).

This builds the digest a shadow can carry: the owner's newest sessions (replay.split_sessions, newest first), each
dated by what it captured (replay.session_moments, REG-2736), its read count by the Shelf's own rule (control_app's
_is_a_live_read, passed in - one predicate, never a copy), the names its reads saw, and up to 3 key frames as the
theatre's own 160 px thumbnails (tv/frames/hist/cache160/<frameId>.jpg, ~11 KB) - frames whose read named something
first, else first / middle / last. A frame with no thumbnail is made by `sips` on a Mac (the theatre's own resizer, into
the theatre's own cache); a PC with no resizer carries the session without pictures and says why, never a full frame.

Caps (the record is KV-bound): a thumbnail over 20 KB is left out and named, and the total stays under 600 KB by
dropping the OLDEST sessions' pictures first, each drop counted. Phase 2 signs and publishes it as the owner's own
roster record; phase 3 draws it in the shadow's Shelf and TV·D. Never raises; writes only the theatre's cache.
