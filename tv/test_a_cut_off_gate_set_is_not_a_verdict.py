"""Board #184 — A JOB THAT CROSSES ITS CEILING GOES SILENT, NOT RED.

GitHub does not FAIL a job that exceeds `timeout-minutes`. It CANCELS it, and `gh run list` then
prints `cancelled`, which reads as "a person pressed a button" rather than "the gate set never
reached a verdict". Measured on `.github/workflows/tv-tests.yml`, gate-set STEP durations pulled
from `gh api .../actions/runs/<id>/jobs` on 2026-09-23:

    35817826235  15m46s   completed
    35820756987  17m25s   completed
    35842043863  19m35s   completed
    35834810032  23m04s   completed
    35815188806  23m13s   completed
    35823272442  23m37s   completed   <- the worst COMPLETED run
    35825866589  24m23s   CUT OFF     <- its true length is UNKNOWN, not 24m23s

Setup before the gate-set step measured 48-64s across those runs, so the worst completed run spent
**24m41s of a 25-minute ceiling — a margin of nineteen seconds**. Whether Konyo gets a verdict is
decided by runner noise, and when he does not get one, nothing anywhere says so. Board #123 spent
weeks quoting a stale gate count ("15", really 28) for exactly this reason.

WHAT THIS GATE PINS
-------------------
1. `agent-suite` carries a step conditioned on `cancelled()`, and the workflow carries a separate
   `verdict` job that `needs` it with an `always()` condition — a second runner, whose clock the
   first one's timeout cannot touch.
2. The verdict script, EXECUTED, exits non-zero for every conclusion that is not `success` — and
   exits ZERO for `success`, which is the baseline that proves the case can tell them apart.
   [[a-law-about-a-row-must-drive-the-row]] — a law about what a row REPORTS has to call the row.
3. The ceiling watchdog treats a missing `GATE_SET_SECONDS` as UNKNOWN rather than 0. An unset
   shell variable in arithmetic is zero, which would read as "the gate set took no time, the margin
   is enormous" — the most reassuring possible lie. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
4. `CEILING_MINUTES` in the watchdog equals `timeout-minutes` on the job. Two copies of one fact,
   and a watchdog measuring against a ceiling that has since moved reports about a number nobody
   uses. [[label-outlived-referent]] [[copy-drift]]
5. The ceiling is not simply RAISED. A ceiling above every real load is an absent detector, and a
   bigger number buys months rather than closing anything. Raising it means editing `CEILING_CAP`
   here and writing down what the new number is derived from.
6. The workflow watches ITSELF in `on: push: paths:`. `TestEveryRoutineCanSeeTheInputItPolices` in
   test_control.py already makes that a law for the five routine workflows; this file was never in
   that list, so every edit to its verdict machinery changed what CI does while triggering nothing.

WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT DO, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED
----------------------------------------------------
It cannot cause a real CI timeout, so GitHub's own scheduling of an `always()` job behind a
timed-out `needs` is **UNVERIFIED until it happens on a runner**. Everything above is proven by
executing the shipped shell here. The one piece of real evidence for the in-job path is run
35825866589, where the gate-set step went `cancelled` and the job's post-steps still ran — so a
step conditioned on `cancelled()` has a real chance of being reached. It is treated as best effort
and nothing depends on it.

⚠ NO `import yaml`. `TestNoSuiteImportsSomethingCIDoesNotHave` bans it outright, bare or guarded,
because v1911 imported it in a test and took the publish workflow down: PyYAML is on his Mac and is
not on the runner. The reader below is a purpose-built indentation walker, and it has its own test
that runs before any verdict built on it is believed. [[source-reading-guard]] §3.5
