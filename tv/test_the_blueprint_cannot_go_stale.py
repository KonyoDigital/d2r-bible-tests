"""v2794 — THE MAP SAID IT COULD NOT GO STALE, AND IT HAD BEEN STALE FOR SIX DAYS.

`tv/blueprint.py`'s own header: *"THE MAP OF THIS SYSTEM, GENERATED FROM THE CODE SO IT CANNOT GO
STALE"* — the right idea, inherited from ~/achilles-revival along with the reverse-blueprint rule.
Nothing regenerated it. Measured 2026-09-08 against the BLUEPRINT.md then on disk:

    last written        Sep 2 (six days)
    `station` mentions  0
    `INTAKE`            0
    `TOMBSTONE`         0
    `printer`           0
    `panelFrames`       0

The river and the printer were both built AFTER that date, so the one surface meant to show the
wiring from above simply did not know they existed. Konyo: *"shouldnt this be a connected and
communicating system thats easily seen wired from a macro view"*. It should — and it was the MAP
that was missing, not the wiring. [[the-unjoined-end]]

=== ⛔ THE GATE REFUSES; IT DOES NOT REGENERATE ===
The obvious move is to have pre-push rebuild the file. That is wrong here and the repo already
knows why: **the gate grades the WORKING TREE**. A hook that rewrote BLUEPRINT.md mid-push would
dirty the tree it is grading, and the commit actually being pushed would still carry the stale
file. So it refuses, a human runs the generator, and the push is retried — the same shape the
second-eye gate uses. [[d2r-push-grades-the-working-tree]]

=== ⚠ THE TIMESTAMP LINE IS EXCLUDED, AND WITHOUT THAT THIS IS FURNITURE ON DAY ONE ===
`render()` stamps `generated YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, which changes every minute. A naive byte-compare
would be RED forever, everyone would learn to skim it, and the real staleness would go with it.
Compare the MAP, not the clock. [[regression-guard]]
