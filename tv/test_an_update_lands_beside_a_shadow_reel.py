"""2026-09-28 — AN UPDATE LANDS BESIDE A SHADOW READER, ON EVERY CONSOLE, BY ITS OWN LOGIC.

HIS WORDS: "the windows needs proper care and attention.. it needs to work perfectly and smoothly
there thats the way we know it will work for dean too. so it needs to work on its own logic" and
"the logic needs to be individually placed and working for each console".

MEASURED 2026-09-28 on his ALT (Windows + Boosteroid, shadow reader always on): the fleet row read
ver v3520 / diskVer v3521 for over two hours, relaunch {armed: true, may: false, why: 'the console is
ON AIR (live) — you are filming'}. Nobody was filming — the SHADOW reader was. It rolls a reel every
hour of play with a ~2 s gap, and nothing_in_flight() read `_agent_mode` + `_agent_alive()` as "you
are filming" without asking whose reel it was. So on any PC where the game stays open, a new build
NEVER landed: the ALT today, Dean whenever he plays long.

WHAT THIS LAW DRIVES — the SHIPPED drift lane (_drift_loop, one iteration), shadow_watch_tick,
_shadow_rollover, the green light and the doctor row, with only the EDGES stubbed (the agent, the
clock, the window finder, the exec), on a TV_HIST fixture, once on a WINDOWS-shaped console (IS_WIN,
the Win32 finder, a bare "Boosteroid" window whose first reads show a D2R HUD word — the ALT) and
once on a MAC-shaped one (the Quartz finder, a named D2R window):

  · shadow reel + a newer build on disk -> the relaunch is HELD, not refused, and says "waiting for
    the shadow reel to close: an update is waiting — the shadow reel closes at its next clean point";
  · the next shadow look closes that reel EARLY (reason "an update is waiting") through
    stop_agent(farewell=False) + the measured-gone check, and fires the green light IN THE SAME
    BREATH — before the watcher could look again;
  · while the update is held (or the relaunch is under way) the watcher opens NO new reel, and says so;
  · ON AIR + drift -> refused, "blocked by his session", nothing closed — at any age;
  · MINI -> the same;
  · a reel whose door cannot be read (an orphan, or a busy lock) -> refused, never guessed shadow's;
  · a hold whose tree goes mid-edit neither closes the reel nor fires (one question, three askers);
  · the doctor row 'the running build is behind the disk': OK inside two hours, MISSING past them
    naming his session / the shadow close failed / the relaunch refused / did not take, UNKNOWN when
    either version cannot be read — and it reads the `since` the drift lane really wrote.

⚠ NOTHING REAL IS TOUCHED. start_agent / stop_agent / _force_kill_all_agents would spawn or kill his
agent, _exec_relaunch_now would REPLACE THIS PROCESS, and the drift lane would git-pull his tree —
every one is stubbed in setUp before anything runs, and the watcher's store is asserted to sit inside
the fixture before anything is written. RED_PROOF below.
