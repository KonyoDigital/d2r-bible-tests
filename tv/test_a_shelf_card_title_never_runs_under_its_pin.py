"""#86 (REG-2755, GrokBot's v3821 and v3823 passes) - A SHELF CARD'S TITLE NEVER RUNS UNDER ITS PIN AND SEAL.

GrokBot saw a card's date wrap "AM" under the ☆ twice. The title was absolute with a fixed right reserve of 104px for
the pin and the seal (v3214), and "🛡 clean" + the pin + their gap + the inset need ~111px in Chrome's mono and more in
his WebKit's: a reserve is a guess about a width it cannot see. The title and the cluster are one flex row now
(.shc-top): the cluster takes what it needs (flex:none), the title takes the rest (min-width:0), whatever the seal says
or the font measures - and the title's time is one unit (.shc-hm), so a narrow card breaks the line at the dot.

The overlap depends on font metrics (CI's fonts are not his), so a geometry check is a floor here and the stylesheet
parse is the proof - the v2229 rule for the console's grid tracks. RED_PROOF below.
