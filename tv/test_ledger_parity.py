"""v2460 — the console and the worker must agree on WHICH LEDGERS EXIST.

⚠ THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. `_masks_for_wire()` has said "every ledger this machine can build,
not a hardcoded one" since v2329, and the worker that RECEIVES those masks stored exactly one:

    const sets = one(m.sets);
    return sets ? { sets: sets } : null;

So a uniques mask would have been discarded on arrival, and the uniques cross-reference could never
have worked end to end no matter what the boards published. Grok measured the board side and I
confirmed it from the live record — both of us were looking at the wrong end. One half generalised,
the other left naming a single ledger, and nothing compared them. [[the-unjoined-end]] [[copy-drift]]

This pins the RULE — the two ends carry the same set — never the roster. Adding a third ledger is
allowed; adding it to only one end is not.
