"""#167 (REG-2484) - NODE.JS ON EVERY WINDOWS PC: ONE DOOR, FOR THE INSTALLER AND FOR THE CONSOLE.

His ruling, 2026-10-21 22:45: BOTH - node on Dean's PC now, and the installer and the console fetch it wherever it is
missing, so the next new PC never needs an SSH session. MEASURED on Dean's PC 2026-10-21: tv/install-tvd.ps1 installed
Git, Python, Claude Code and the Grok CLI and no node, so 53+ node-only laws skipped there and the eagle's 'their
tooltip rows' read "node absent ... the composition was NOT run" for 14 days - until an agent hand-placed portable node
v24.22.1 at %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\nodejs, the folder the resolver already looks in (cb_node_harness.NODE_KNOWN).
This makes that hand step the code's.

CONTRACT: ensure(blocking=False, why="") -> {"ok", "node", "fetched", "onPath", "why"}. Never raises.
    ok       True: node is on this PC. False: it is not, and `why` says why. None: a fetch is running in the background.
    node     the binary, or None.
    fetched  True only on the answer of the run that placed it.
    onPath   node's folder is on THIS process's PATH (what heart2's node probe and every child process inherit).
CLI: python tv/node_runtime.py --ensure     the installer's one call; exit 0 = node is here, 1 = it is not.

THE STEPS - Windows only; macOS and Linux resolve and never fetch:
  1. resolve through cb_node_harness.node_path(), the ONE resolver (TV_NODE, PATH, then the known locations);
  2. absent: the pinned portable zip tv/node_pin.json names for this PC's architecture;
  3. its SHA-256 against the pin BEFORE anything is extracted - a mismatch extracts nothing, and says so;
  4. extracted into a temp folder beside the target (one volume, so the last step is a rename), its node.exe checked
     against the pin's own node.exe hash (nodejs.org publishes both), then RENAMED into %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\nodejs;
  5. that folder put first on os.environ['PATH'] for THIS process only - no setx, no registry, no profile, no admin.
     Nothing of his changes outside that one folder, and deleting it is the whole uninstall;
  6. cb_node_harness.NODE resolved again, so the tooltip-oracle lane sees node without a relaunch.
blocking=False runs steps 2-6 on a background thread, ONCE per process: a failed fetch is said, never retried in a loop.
A node that is already here but whose folder is off PATH gets step 5 alone (Windows), so its children inherit it.

Authenticode is not asked: the pin is the stronger check - it names the exact bytes nodejs.org published, where a
signature names only the publisher - and asking WinVerifyTrust costs a ctypes surface or a PowerShell spawn per install.
