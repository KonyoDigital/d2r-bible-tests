"""v2746 — THE LEDGER AUTHORITY: one manager over every ledger, and one answer per ledger.

Konyo, 2026-09-06, reading Dean's fleet card — a single warning band sitting above three rows:

    "for this deans chronicle the seed thing. how does that get removed what of him to do? like it
     should read he hasnt yet synced his uniques.. sets and runewords has been verified by him
     already and accepted.. maybe thats like a little toggle also needed to bypass this?"

and then, the shape he asked for:

    "a unified logic maybe or like a manager of them ... a unified ledger extracting from all
     ledgers with all data based on whats needed to be used and routed to the necesary routes and
     end routes based on whereever they came from regardless of the route reel. like the evidence
     is ledgers and proof and the manual is also a bypass we said like witnesses are not needed for
     a manual toggle me or dean.. or user."

and then, the part that makes a constant unusable as an answer:

    "_GRAIL_SEED 245 uniques but this is my owner seed.. and even that is so outdated.. its at
     292/403 we already said and sets 123/135.... it needs to auto update and not be stale"


=== THE DEFECT ===

`onOwnerSeed` is ONE BOOLEAN answering a THREE-LEDGER question. `control_ui.html:19562` renders
`t.onOwnerSeed === true` as one blanket band above SETS, UNIQUES and RUNEWORDS alike, so it cannot
say which of the three is actually inherited. The board computes it as `window._seedsBelongHere`
(`bible.html:4008`) — a whole-BOARD flag. It is not over-broad; it is UNSPECIFIC, which is a
different defect with a different fix.

MEASURED on his own live board 2026-09-06, and the three ledgers do not agree with each other:

    uniques    292/403   246 of the 311 chronicle rows are seed names carrying the SEED'S OWN DATE
    sets       123/135   108 of the 123 rows are seed names       ->  15 are his, found since
    runewords   99/99     99 of the 99 rows are seed names        ->   0 are his, and 99/99 is FULL

One flag over that is not a summary, it is an average of three different sentences.


=== WHY A CONSTANT CANNOT BE THE ANSWER ===

Every seed is a hardcoded literal transcribed from screenshots, and it CARRIES NO TIMESTAMP OF ITS
OWN. The uniques seed holds 245 names against a board at 292 — 47 finds behind — and nothing in the
file says when it was written. This module therefore refuses to hold a single seed number: every
size is PARSED out of `bible.html` on demand, by brace-matching and `json.loads`, never by regex and
never from a constant here. A seed that grows tomorrow must not make this file lie.

⚠ AND THE ONE AGE IT CAN OFFER IS NAMED FOR WHAT IT IS. `newestFindDate` is the newest find-date
RECORDED INSIDE the seed — it is not when the seed was transcribed, and that remains UNKNOWN rather
than being inferred from it. [[stale-reading]] — the age of the THING, not of the fetch.


=== THE MANUAL BYPASS, AND WHY IT NEEDS NO WITNESS ===

Konyo's ruling #166 stands: *"manual anything is enough witness obivously"*. A person declaring
whose chronicle this is supplies the one input no heuristic can — `bible.html:3997` is a HEURISTIC
("a board with a chronicle already on it is the one the seed was written for") and it is the whole
vector, because Dean would never type "KonyoEndgame".

So `manual_accept()` takes no corroboration. It records WHO, WHEN and WHICH LEDGER, and:

  ⛔ IT CANNOT CHANGE A COUNT. The ladder doctrine — a profile toggle must never change a count —
     applies whole. Every count in a `classify_*` result is computed before any manual record is
     consulted, and the record is applied by `_label_only()`, which writes exactly one key:
     `provenance`. `test_ledger_authority.py` proves it by running the classifier with and without
     the record and comparing every other field byte for byte.


=== WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO ===

  * IT NEVER WRITES A LEDGER. It reads stores and reports. The only file it writes is its own
    manual-bypass record. Repairing is `bible.html`'s job and happens on the person's own machine.
  * `0` IS MEASURED-AND-ZERO, `None` IS NOBODY LOOKED. A store that could not be read is None
    everywhere, never 0. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
  * A NEGATIVE `beyondSeed` IS REPORTED, NEVER CLAMPED. Dean's runewords read 94 against a seed of
    99: `max(0, ...)` would print a tidy 0 and hide that five seeded rows are MISSING from his
    store. The deficit is the finding. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]
  * NO ITEM NAME EVER CROSSES THE WIRE. `functions/api/console.js` declares that boundary and
    refuses even `ledgerName`/`seedLedger` as identity strings. Remote rows are therefore classified
    from COUNTS ONLY, and every derived figure is marked `derived: True` rather than dressed up as
    a measurement.

#
#     owner  main    ''                 owner  ladder  'L·'
#     guest  main    'I·<id8>·'         guest  ladder  'IL·<id8>·'
#     cousin main    'W·'               cousin ladder  'WL·'          (the pre-v1499 shared world)
#
# A figure read WITHOUT the router reads whatever world the reader happens to be in, and a CDP probe
# is a GUEST (`navigator.webdriver && file:` flips `d2r_owned` from bare to `I·<id8>·`). So every
# figure this module returns names the world it came from, and `compare_figures` REFUSES a
# cross-world comparison rather than producing a number that describes two boards at once.

#: ⚠⚠ KEYS THAT ARE BARE IN EVERY WORLD BY CONSTRUCTION, AND WHY THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
#: I read `d2r_ledgerName` being written RAW at five sites (bible.html:4601, 10065, 10261, 10265,
#: 10269) and ROUTED at one (:19557, through `LS = window.LSR || window.localStorage`), plus read
#: routed at :19556 and :19566 — and was about to report that the uniques reset names a PREFIXED key
#: on a ladder profile while the resolver reads the bare one, so the seed would refill after a reset
#: that promised in a dialog it would not.
#: ⛔ THAT IS REFUTED. `LSR.key()` (bible.html:4092-4096) prefixes ONLY keys in `_LP_FORKED` or
#: `_WP_FORKED`, and `d2r_ledgerName` is in NEITHER — measured. So routed and raw resolve to the
#: same bare key in all six worlds, and the comment at :4089 says so in as many words: "UI prefs
#: match no fork set -> bare in every world, so every world LOOKS identical and bare-key presence
#: can never be read as ownership." The inconsistency is cosmetic.
#: Recorded here so nobody spends the afternoon re-deriving it, and because the fact is LOAD-BEARING

# ══ THE CANONICAL FIGURE — ONE SOURCE, ONE COUNTING RULE, PER LEDGER ══════════════════════════

#: Konyo: *"sets also needs to be fetched from the right data so it also renders like the sets tab
#: 123/135 counter"*. So each ledger declares ONE store, ONE denominator and ONE counting rule, and
#: both surfaces read this instead of each computing its own.
#:
#: THE RULE IS `|roster ∩ store|`, NOT `len(store)`, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT ACADEMIC. The fleet
#: card's numerator is `d2r_setPieces.length` (control_app.py:11847 via g() at :11715) while the
#: Sets tab counts `pieces.filter(p => setPieces.has(p))` (bible.html:23696). They agree only while
#: the store is a SUBSET of the roster, and nothing checks that. `len(store)` can exceed the
#: denominator; the intersection cannot. A numerator that can pass its own denominator is not a
#: progress figure. MEASURED on his live store: 123 == 123, so the divergence is LATENT here — which
#: is exactly why a gate must exercise the direction his data never takes.

#
#     THE SEED     245/108/99, hardcoded in bible.html, NO TIMESTAMP ANYWHERE.

#                  MEASURED on his tree: 62 restore points, newest 43.8 min old, cadence 15-25 min,
#                  counts chronFound 292 · setPieces 123 · runewordsMade 99.
#
# So the backup is the live truth WITH an age, and the seed is a frozen floor WITHOUT one. Preferring

    reads `d2r_owned` — the VAULT — while `grail_tally` moved the `uniques` pair to `chronFound`,
    the CHRONICLE, in v2717 ("`uniques` NOW ANSWERS THE SAME QUESTION THE BOARD'S TABS DO",
    control_app.py:2004). control_app renamed the vault pair to `vaultUniques`; fleet_mask did not
    follow. So `fleet_compare(machine, "uniques")` — his "show me what he has that i dont" — decodes
    a VAULT mask and labels it uniques, beside a card showing a CHRONICLE number.

        MEASURED, popcount vs tally, on the live fleet:

            uniques  Dean 249 vs   0     Konyo 292 vs 160     <- different stores, same label

    Dean's vault mask is EMPTY, so a uniques cross-reference against him answers "he owns none"
    while his card reads 249/403. Both numbers are honest about different questions.
