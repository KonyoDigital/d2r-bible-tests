"""2026-09-28 — THE FLEET CARD SAYS HOW EACH PC FILMS AND DRAINS, AND THE RIVER SAYS WHAT ITS TRIAGE LANE IS DOING.

His order: "make sure its all properly rendering everywhere". The beacon fields shipped on the wire the same day
(tv/test_the_beacon_says_how_each_pc_films_and_drains.py drives them to /api/fleet):

    system.capture = {route: native|boosteroid|geforce-now|unknown, ageS, why, source}
    system.river   = {lanes: {STATION: n} | None, ageS, why, triage: {lastKey, lastWhy, backlog, sinceLastS, ...}}
    formerMachines = [{machine, lastSeen, ver}]       (one install that reported under two host names)

and /api/river carries `triage` (triage_lane_state()). The fleet card in tv/control_ui.html drew NONE of the first
three and the river panel drew nothing of the fourth: the wire carried it and no reader spent it — the seventh-joint
shape the worker's shaper already names. [[the-unjoined-end]]

WHAT THIS LAW DRIVES — the SHIPPED helpers cut from control_ui.html between real anchors and RUN in node over fixture
rows (never re-typed here), and the SHIPPED card rendered in a real headless Chrome from a stubbed /api/fleet:
  · A ROUTE IS NAMED WITH THE AGE OF ITS PIN: native / Boosteroid / GeForce NOW, aged ageS + (now - the row's record
    time `t`) — the pin's age when the beacon left, plus how long the site has held that beacon. An offline machine's
    route keeps ageing; a row with no `t` reads "age UNKNOWN", never "just now". [[stale-reading]]
  · UNKNOWN IS NEVER 0: an unnamed route, no lane map, an unreadable triage lane and a console older than the fields
    each read UNKNOWN in words; a null backlog is "owed UNKNOWN", never "0 owed"; a null lane map never "TRIAGE 0".
  · THE RIVER'S STATIONS in the order that console counted them, zero stations left out, with the river's age.
  · THE TRIAGE LANE IN WORDS: walking / caught up / "standing aside for his game" / "last refusal: <words>", with
    the backlog and the last walk's age.
  · A RENAMED HOST is a quiet "formerly <name>" line under the row that absorbed it.
  · THE RIVER PANEL'S ONE LINE: the backlog, the last walk's age, the last refusal in words, "standing aside for his
    game" when that is the state, UNKNOWN when absent — and _shLanesRender draws it on every path, lanes or none.
  · THE JOIN, in Chrome: _fleetRefresh over a stubbed /api/fleet draws every row's films / river / triage line and
    the "formerly" line, and nothing in the card scrolls sideways at 901 and 1280 wide.
ROUND 2 (2026-09-28, three findings of the adversarial review, each reproduced on fe817ab7):
  · REG-1377 NO MIDDOT IS STRANDED BY A WRAP: the facts of a line were one middot-joined string, so at 375 a river line
    began "· CAPTURE 4 ·" and at 1280 a triage line ended "walking (53s ago) ·". Each fact is its own flex item (the
    river's own .shr-tri fix); measured in Chrome at 375 and 1280, line by line from the characters' own rects: no
    line of a fact row starts or ends with a middot, and at 375 some row really wraps (the case is not vacuous).
  · REG-1378 AN AGE THE CARD CANNOT ESTABLISH IS "age UNKNOWN": the "formerly" line took _fleetSince's age, which says
    "just now" for a lastSeen it cannot parse and for one after now; and _fleetSince itself said "just now" for any
    time it could not read. A lane that has TICKED but whose last outcome did not survive the wire said "no tick yet";
    now "last outcome unreadable" (ticks > 0), "no tick yet" only at 0 ticks, UNKNOWN when ticks were not sent - on the
    fleet row and on the river's own line.

⚠ NOTHING REAL IS TOUCHED: fixture rows only, a file:// page with fetch stubbed at document start, its own headless
Chrome on its own port (render_check's handle, killed by it). No console, no store, no network. RED_PROOF below.
