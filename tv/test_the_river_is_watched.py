"""v2742 — THE TWO MODULES AT THE CENTRE OF THE RIVER WERE WATCHED BY NOTHING.

Konyo: *"all connected to the heart of the console obviously so they flag themselves and wilson
score whatever is logically needed"*.

MEASURED the heart's real coverage BEFORE adding anything, because a fourth watcher over a
well-watched module is decoration while the centre goes unguarded:

    module            corroborate invariants     console_doctor checks
    reel_router                 0                        0     <- the STATION ASSIGNER
    printer                     0                        0     <- the STORYLINE
    reel_story                  7                        0
    one_funnel                  8                        0
    frame_authority            15                        0
    reel_retention             13                        1

`reel_router` assigns one station per reel — the whole stamp — and was watched by no invariant,
checked by no doctor row, and read by no console code at all (`grep -c reel_router
tv/control_app.py` -> 0). Built, correct, covered by its own suite, and invisible to every
supervision layer in the repo. That is the shape of every defect this heart exists to catch, in the
module that describes the pipeline.

=== WHAT THIS FILE PINS, AND WHY EACH IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS ===

1. THE DOCTOR ROW IS RED TODAY, ON PURPOSE. 24 of 40 reels sit at a station owing work no automatic
   lane delivers (PRINTER 11 · STATION 7 · EMPTY 6). A check that could only ever be green measures
   nothing, so this file asserts the row CAN fail rather than asserting it passes.

2. IT MUST EXCLUDE THE BY-DESIGN STATIONS. JOIN (4) owes a code change and CAPTURE (12) owes a
   capture change (REG-340). Counting those makes the row read 40 of 40, which is true and useless
   — a row that cries wolf gets ignored, and a distrusted instrument is a switched-off one.

3. THE INVARIANT USES `==`, NOT `<=`. A router stationing FEWER reels than the shelf holds is
   silently dropping some; MORE means it invented one. Both are defects, so neither half may be
   quietly conceded.

4. ⛔ NO WILSON SCORE ON A STATE. A wilson lock belongs on a claim that can be ATTACKED. "The river
   is moving" is a READING — manufacturing attacks to give it a number is the inflation
   `_hardening_gap` refuses, and this file asserts no such lock was created.
