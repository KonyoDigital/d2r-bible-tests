"""THE SWEEP SAYS HOW LONG IT HAS BEEN READING — and in the unit it actually buys.

HIS ASK, 2026-09-15: *"time meter for the sweep i want included integrated and installed so i can
see it in th esticky tab console section on the right nder the fleet"*.

WHAT WAS MEASURED WHEN IT WAS BUILT. A vault sweep was live on his console: 43.9 minutes in, 74
paid classify runs and 220 pages spent. Nothing on screen could say any of it, and the one figure
the panel did print read "reels 0 of 14" — because `reelsDone` is written exactly once, at the
very end, from the proposal's `sessionsSeen`.

THE PIECE THAT WAS MISSING WAS THE JOIN, NOT THE MATH. `sweep_eta()` has existed since v2156,
carries its own tests, and already refuses to invent a figure — it returns ok:False plus a `why`
rather than a confident zero. It was wired to the CHRONICLE lane only. The lane that spends the
money had no clock at all. [[the-unjoined-end]]

THIS LAW PINS FOUR THINGS, each of which was FALSE before v3180:

  1. vault_sweep_state() carries an `eta`. Without it the rail meter has nothing to render and
     silently shows an empty card.
  2. That eta is measured in REELS. vault_retro.sweep's own docstring is "PAY FOR RUNS, NOT
     FRAMES — ONE call per candidate still-run"; handing the vault job to sweep_eta's frame-shaped
     defaults divides a run count by a frame count. That is the wrong-population scar already
     recorded at control_app v2168, committed a second time in a second lane.
  3. A sweep that has never run does NOT report a zero. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]
  4. The meter is STARTED, not merely defined. Four separate defects in this repo have been
     "both ends built, never joined". [[plumbing-with-no-tap]]

⚠ ON HOW THIS READS THE SOURCE. The claims about Python are checked by PARSING, never by
substring — three laws in this repo have matched their own explanatory comments and passed while
the code they described was absent. The one claim about JS strips comments before matching,
because the comment beside the tap discusses the tap. [[source-reading-guard]]
