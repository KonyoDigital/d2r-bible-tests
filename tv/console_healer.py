"""THE SCAR LEDGER AND THE HEALER — what the watchdog does with what it sees.

Konyo, 2026-08-24: "teach watchdog and eagle eye and give it the capabilities to see this so when
it happens in the future it can auto scar / auto heal / auto fix."

The eagle SEES and the watchdog LOOKS ON A TIMER. Neither of them REMEMBERS, and neither of them
ACTS. That gap is the whole reason he keeps finding the same thing twice: a fault that appears,
gets fixed, and comes back reads exactly like a fault appearing for the first time, so nothing in
the system can say the words "this is a REGRESSION" — the one sentence that would have changed
what I did.

So this module is two halves, and they are deliberately different sizes.

  THE LEDGER (auto-scar) — every red the watchdog sees is written down: what it was, when it FIRST
  appeared, when it last appeared, when it cleared, and HOW MANY TIMES IT HAS COME BACK. Cheap,
  safe, and it applies to every fault without exception. A fault that has cleared and returned is
  reported as a RETURN, with the count, forever.

  THE HEALER (auto-fix) — a NAMED remedy for a NAMED fault, and only where the repair is
  RE-DERIVABLE FROM EVIDENCE rather than an act of judgement. That line is his, from
  [[sweep-dont-ask]], and it is the whole safety argument: folding orphan frames into the reel
  whose stamp they already carry is arithmetic. Deciding which of his items to throw out is not.
  Most faults get NO remedy, and that is the correct answer, not a gap to fill later.

FOUR LAWS, each of which exists because its absence is a way this module could hurt him:

  1. RE-DERIVABLE ONLY. If the repair needs a preference, a threshold, or a guess about intent, it
     is not a remedy. It is a report.
  2. HEAL, RE-MEASURE, AND DISARM ON FAILURE. Every heal is followed by running the SAME check
     again. If the check is still red, that remedy is disarmed for the life of the process and the
     scar records that it was tried and did not work. A remedy that can be retried forever is a
     loop, and a loop that touches his files is the worst thing in this file.
  3. NOTHING IS DESTRUCTIVE. No remedy deletes, truncates or overwrites his data. The strongest
     thing any of them may do is MOVE a file into the place its own stamp says it belongs, or
     restore a backup this module itself wrote while the store was healthy.
  4. OPT-IN, AND SILENT MEANS OFF. Healing requires TV_AUTO_HEAL=1. With it unset the module still
     scars everything — remembering costs nothing and risks nothing — and reports what it WOULD
     have done, so the remedy can be read before it is ever armed.
