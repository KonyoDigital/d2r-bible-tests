"""REG-2614 - A WINDOWS CONSOLE THAT DIED IS BROUGHT BACK WITHIN MINUTES, WITH NO SIGN-IN.

2026-10-16: the ALT's console died with no error, and nothing relaunched it until someone next signed in to Windows -
it missed 302 commits of updates. The sign-in start (REG-1660) runs once, at sign-in; nothing watched a console that
died afterwards. This is the Windows cousin of tvd_supervisor.sh: Task Scheduler runs it every few minutes, hidden
(pythonw), as the signed-in user, and it starts the launcher with -Background only when the console is GONE.

    python console_keepalive.py           one pass: probe :17772, decide, maybe launch, log one line
    python console_keepalive.py --install-unattended USER [--password-env NAME]
                                          the owner's one-time install of the task that runs with nobody
                                          signed in (REG-2616); the password comes from $NAME, never argv

Safe to run any number of times, beside a running console or another pass:
  - a console that answers, or is merely slow (a connect that times out - the ALT stalls for minutes under load),
    is left alone; only a REFUSED port (nothing listening) is "gone";
  - a console closed on purpose (X / Quit writes .tvd_exited_on_purpose) or a stood-down supervisor
    (.tvd_supervisor_pause) is never relaunched - a choice is not a crash;
  - one launch per LAUNCH_COOLDOWN_S, so a console that dies at boot is not relaunched in a storm;
  - the launcher it starts holds its own mutex and leaves a running console exactly as it is (start_tvd_win.ps1).
Never raises; stdlib only; imports nothing of the console's. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
