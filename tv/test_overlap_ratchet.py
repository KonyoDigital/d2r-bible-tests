"""The overlap ratchet's own arithmetic — the half that does not need a browser.

⚠⚠ THIS FILE IS A DEBT BEING PAID. `overlap_ratchet` shipped at v2605 with no unit suite, and its
gate `why` said so out loud. One version earlier I had been bitten by exactly that: `reel_templates`
had classified all forty of his reels since v2571 with nothing testing it (REG-586). Shipping the
same shape twice in two versions is how a rule becomes a thing you write down instead of a thing
you do.

⚠ NOTHING HERE STARTS A BROWSER. `measure()` is replaced per test, so these grade the RATCHET —
rise, fall, unknown, malformed — and never the page. The pixel half is exercised by the gate itself
against real pixels every run, which is the stronger check and a different one.
