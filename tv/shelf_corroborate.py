"""THE SHELF'S CORROBORATOR — three independent witnesses to one reel, compared.

⚠⚠ WHY THIS ORGAN AND NOT ANOTHER. Konyo opened a session on 2026-09-13 and the shelf
card said `19 frames · full video` while the dossier for the SAME reel said `0 FRAMES`.
Both surfaces were honest about what they read; nothing existed whose job was to notice
they disagreed. An eagle watches cheaply, a watchdog asks if a thing is alive, a doctor
asks if a check passes — none of them compares two witnesses. That is this organ's
whole job, and on its first run it reported **52 of 53 reels** disagreeing.

THE THREE WITNESSES, deliberately independent:

    dossier   `frames`    from the journal group  — what the detail page prints
    card      `footageN`  from the reel directory — what the shelf card prints
    disk      f_*.jpg     counted here, fresh     — what is actually on disk

MEASURED 2026-09-13, and the pattern is the finding:

    n=9      dossier=5    card=1208  disk=1208
    n=12     dossier=30   card=1208  disk=1208
    n=15     dossier=10   card=19    disk=19
    n=3128   dossier=0    card=19    disk=19     <- the reel he opened

`card` and `disk` agree EVERY time; `dossier` is the odd witness. In
control_app._theatre_sessions the number comes from

    frames = [r for r in sess if r.get("frameId") and os.path.isfile(...)]

which counts JOURNAL ROWS IN THAT GROUP, not frames of film — and replay.split_sessions
then divides those rows across duplicate groups, so one reel reads 10 in one row and 0 in
another while 19 stills sit on disk. A label naming another quantity, split by a second
bug. [[label-outlived-referent]] [[the-unjoined-end]]

⚠ IT REPORTS, IT NEVER REPAIRS. A corroborator that edited the thing it watches could
make two witnesses agree by changing one of them, which is how a contradiction gets
buried instead of found. Every row here is a reading. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

    saw THE ROGUE ENCAMPMENT, and said *"i made sure and its not related at all to stash! so this
    was wrongly stashed"*. He was right.

    The console carries TWO scene tallies and they are not the same measurement:

        kaiClasses   the 3-bucket collapse — stash / gameplay / tooltip. control_app says so in
                     its own comment: "richer scene breakdown ALONGSIDE kaiClasses (which
                     collapses to stash/gameplay/tooltip)". THERE IS NO TOWN BUCKET, so a town
                     frame has nowhere else to go.
        sceneReads   the journal's own `scene` field per deep read — transition, town, loot,
                     gameplay, stash — the real Diablo vocabulary.

    MEASURED 2026-09-13: of 148 sessions carrying BOTH, **137 name different scenes** (93%).
    One example straight out of his shelf:

        kaiClasses ['gameplay','stash','tooltip']   vs   sceneReads ['transition']

    ⚠ THE ROOT CAUSE IS UPSTREAM AND THIS DOES NOT PRETEND OTHERWISE. His frame's native read was
    `{'kind': 'menu', 'label': 'STASH'}` — produced by the capture/classify lane, not by the
    console. Renaming a label here would be cosmetic. What the console CAN do is stop the
