"""v3171 (#96) — THE SWEEP MUST READ THE REELS THAT ACTUALLY SHOW A STASH.

MEASURED on his machine 2026-09-15, and it is the whole reason the vault has no receipts:

    45 sessions swept · 36 of them (80%) took NOTHING · 39 rows banked in total
    the THREE best stash-panel reels — one at 100% density — had NEVER BEEN SWEPT
    stash bank: 12 accumulator keys      chronicle bank: 8517 sightings over 324 names

The sweeper took reels in DIRECTORY ORDER filtered only by "not already sealed". The ranking it
needed already existed — vault_retro.panel_density, whose own docstring says it is free precisely
so "the sweep can afford to ask it about every reel before paying to read any of them" — and was
computed ONLY inside a doctor row that PRINTS it. Chooser built, sweeper built, never joined.
[[the-unjoined-end]] [[plumbing-with-no-tap]]

★ WHAT THIS PINS
  1. rank_by_panel orders by density, highest first;
  2. a reel whose gate RAISES sorts last, never first — "I could not measure it" must never be
     promoted over "I measured it and it is good";
  3. ties keep their original order, so ranking only ever reorders by evidence;
  4. the SWEEPER actually calls it (parsed from the function body, not grepped at file scope);
  5. the doctor and the sweeper use ONE ranker, so the console cannot hold two answers to
     "which reel next";
  6. vault_bank reports UNKNOWN rather than zero when a bank cannot be read.

    the architcure and not getting stuck anywhere just extracted and tallied and flowing... the

    come in.. i want it coming in organzied and going out orgainzied"*.
