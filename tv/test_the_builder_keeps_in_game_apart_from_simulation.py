"""#103 — THE CHARACTERS HE HAS IN GAME, AND THE BUILDS HE TRIES THINGS WITH, IN TWO SECTIONS.

Konyo, 2026-09-30: "this is specifically for the characters that are known by the console and are legit my character..
so they slowly prove themselves from reels sessions and harden same way as vault.... this is an area to create and test
other builds like simulation style.. so the add character and everything stays as is.. just maybe segregated like with a
section for each so its known that those are the characters ingame we have".

What this law holds, each piece driven through the SHIPPED code (never re-typed here):
  · THE TIER IS THE VAULT'S. tv/char_select.proof counts a character's LOOKS (character-select visits that read it) over
    its TRIALS (visits since it first appeared) and asks vault_evidence.tier - WATCHED under 10, PROVEN at 10, HARDENED
    at 20, and a character the screen stops showing falls back. A visit with no time is UNKNOWN, never a guess, and
    char_select defines no bars of its own (one source).
  · ONE RULE SORTS A BUILD (window._cbSections): made from a learned character (b.from) or carrying its name, folded the
    way the learner folds -> in game, under that character; anything else -> simulation. Level-1 learned characters are
    the mules group. A console that has not answered is UNKNOWN - never "none" - and every build stands in simulation.
  · THE 👤 CHARACTERS ROOM paints two sections, in-game first: a character with builds shows them as its cards, each
    wearing its proof; one with none is a dashed card whose "Plan a build" opens the planner on a draft of it (nothing
    written until he changes it). Simulation is the cards they always were, MAIN first; + New character is untouched.
  · THE PLANNER'S BUILD LIST says the same sections: ⚔ In game (the learned characters, their builds in their place, a
    character with none offered as "not saved yet" with its tier), the mules group, 🧪 Simulation builds + New build.
The room's harness is test_the_characters_tab_is_manual_and_separate's own (imported, not copied), with a console answer
fed through the page's real /api/chars_learned fetch. [[the-unjoined-end]] [[unknown-stays-unknown]] [[copy-drift]]
