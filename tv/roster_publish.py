"""Fleet 3.0 phase 1 — what this PC publishes, and when.

The presence beacon stays on /api/console and never carries an item name.
This module builds a separate body for POST /api/roster. The KV key is the
owner label, not an install id, a hostname, or a path.

A section that was not read is left out. An empty list is not a stand-in
for that. Pictures and frame bytes are dropped before the post. The post
itself is change-only, at most once an hour, plus one at boot. The boot post
goes even when nothing changed here (#95): the server skips the write when
its stored hash matches, and overwrites a row someone else wrote in this PC's
name. The server, not this file, enforces the daily cap.

#95 - every row the server returns carries intentVerified: true (signed by the
owner's registered key), false (published without a signature that key made),
or no field at all (published before signing), which every view here shows as
UNKNOWN and never as either answer. tv/roster_sign.py signs; this file carries
what the server said to every view, the panel's payload and the doctor.
