"""THE RIVER DRAINS EVERY PASS — FIFO, KEEP THE NEWEST 8, EACH CONSOLE ITS OWN.

HIS WORDS, 2026-09-27: *"session reels in shelf registered by FIFO first in first out and getting
extracted and tallied and ledgered accoridngly to its won indivudal console. and that it can be seen
in shelf rendering and allproeprly getting delted after the 8 sessions"* — and #255: *"getting pruned
and extracted data wise and eventually tombstones to get deleted.. that way storage is always smooth
and optimized and not stacking up"* / *"its already suppose to do this"* / *"as architecture"*.

WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE ANY OF THIS WAS WRITTEN — and the brief's root cause did NOT survive it:

  · The brief said the pass only frees under disk pressure (`free_mb=(need_mb or None)`). Above
    floor+headroom that expression is None — NO target — and has been since v2226. His live console
    (GET /api/status, 11.8 GB free) reported `eligible: 0`: 19 reel dirs = 8 test fixtures + the
    newest 8 + 3 held `panels-never-banked`. His drain was at its floor, correctly.
  · The REAL defect was the band at or below floor+headroom: there `need_mb` is positive, plan()
    stopped after selecting that much, and every other finished reel was held `target-met`.
    Driven here on 4 finished reels with 0.5 MB needed: ONE released, three held. Disk pressure freed
    LESS than a roomy disk — the inversion of what pressure is for. His disk falls ~0.6 GB/day toward it.
  · And nothing watched the mouth: shelf_driver's `deleter` lane declares no work period, so a drain
    that stopped with reels owed could only ever read UNTIMED.

WHAT THIS LAW DRIVES — the SHIPPED `control_app._retention_once` and `reel_retention.apply_plan`, on
fixture worlds, with a pinned clock and a pinned disk, counting which directories survive:

  1. twelve finished reels + one that is NOT sealed: with plenty of disk the four oldest finished
     reels are released OLDEST FIRST, the unsealed one is KEPT AND NAMED (tag + why), the newest
     KEEP_RECENT are never touched, and a second pass releases nothing more;
  2. disk pressure — inside the headroom band AND below the floor — releases every finished reel,
     never fewer than a roomy disk would;
  3. every path resolves from THAT console's own tree: tombstones and the per-pass series land in
     the fixture world, never in tv/;
  4. THE HEART: the drain speaks on/worked/lastTs/owed; three passes that carry the same owed reels
     and release nothing read STOPPED, and a relaunch in between cannot reset that; a busy drain
     that releases every pass never cries wolf; the doctor row reads the wire and goes MISSING on a
     stopped drain, UNKNOWN when the plan cannot run, UNMEASURED on a console that never filmed;
  5. a deleter that REFUSES (its lock holds) is said as a refusal, never as "freed 0 MB".

⚠ #84 (REG-1517) — the world's reels are PLACED ON ITS RIVER as they are made (finished -> ROUTED,
unsealed -> PRINTER), because the drain now reads the river's own positions beside the mouth: a
mouth that drained with an unsealed reel older than the newest KEEP_RECENT still at PRINTER is
BLOCKED / owed 1, not CLEAR / owed 0 — the ALT's defect in miniature, and this world always had it.
A world nobody stamped would read UNKNOWN (a floor), never CLEAR. The river's own law is
test_the_drain_names_what_is_blocked_upstream.

⚠ No reel id is written literally in this file: a real-looking id in test source makes retention
hold that footage as a fixture (test_no_pinned_footage). Ids are minted from a 2017 stamp.
⚠ Nothing here touches his tree: TV_HIST, rr.HERE and ca.HERE all point at a scratch world, and the
import-time stores are redirected BEFORE control_app is imported.
