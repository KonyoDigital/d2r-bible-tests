"""v2714 — THE CHRONICLE DENOMINATOR WAS RE-DERIVED AT ELEVEN SITES AND THEY DISAGREED IN PUBLIC.

Konyo, 2026-09-06: *"this needs a unified and sharing logic.. no reason for it to render something
in the roster or fleet different from the consoles main tabs Uniques/Sets/runewords"*. He raised it
because the numbers on his own screen did not agree, and he was right.

MEASURED on his live console, `GET /api/fleet`, twice, six minutes apart, same machine, same board:

    10:33:26   uniques {have: 169, total: 398}
    10:39:39   uniques {have: 292, total: 403}
    Dean       uniques {have: 0,   total: 398}
    his board's own Chronicle meter:            258 / 403

THREE numerators and TWO denominators under ONE field name, and nothing on any surface said which
question had been answered. The denominators are not three bugs — they are three questions:

    403   chronTotal — HIS PINNED RULING, the game's own Chronicle count
    392   funiScan().total — the carded roster after his v2680 one-tally-per-sunder ruling
    398   produced by NEITHER, and no array on the page is that size

=== WHAT THIS PINS ===
`x.chronTotal || x.total` appeared at ELEVEN sites. Nine of them ask the same question and now call
ONE function, `window.d2rChronTotal`. Two are left alone ON PURPOSE and this file protects that too:

    _darkN   = chronTotal - total    the still-dark rows — genuinely needs BOTH numbers
    _uniLeft = chronTotal - found    already uses chronTotal alone, with no fallback

A blanket unification would have destroyed the distinction the function exists to protect, which is
why this gate counts the survivors instead of demanding zero. [[copy-drift]]

⚠ AND IT PINS THE FALLBACK'S *COUNTER*, NOT JUST THE FALLBACK. Returning null would put NaN on his
screen, so the guess is kept — but in one place, and it counts itself. `window.__d2rChronFallbacks`
is the measurement that can finally answer where 398 came from. An unmeasured fallback is exactly
how eleven sites came to disagree without anyone noticing. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
