"""REG-2522 (V1 round 3; the review of REG-2411, rv6) - A MULE ROSTER THAT LACKS A CORE LOCKER IS UNKNOWN, NEVER A ROSTER.

The REG-2411 shape check asked only that every element of a saved roster is a mule - and every element of "[]" is. "[]"
is exactly the bytes REG-2414's merge bug stored, so it is the next value GrokBot's malformed-roster sweep tries. On load
the migrations saved a three-locker roster (runewords, magic-rare, shared) over it, the 8 core lockers (which cannot be
deleted, REG-2195) never came back, and the paint's W6 prune dropped every filing on uni-weap, uni-armor, the sets, the
dupes and the rest; saveA wrote the pruned map. Nothing quarantined, the vault not held, nothing said. A roster missing
one core locker did the same to that locker's filings. Reviewer, on the shipped head, migrations and prune: map
{Grief:uni-weap, Shako:uni-armor, Enigma:runewords} + roster "[]" -> quarantined [], held null, prune -> {Enigma:runewords},
saveA() true.

NOW (as narrowed by the REG-2522 fix round - "a roster without a core locker did not come from this board" was false:
until REG-2195 every locker but SHARED STASH had a delete button, so a pre-10-14 roster may lack WIP and must read; that
half is tv/test_a_roster_this_board_wrote_is_read_and_keeps_his_mules.py):
  * an EMPTY roster ("[]") is the wrong shape at the one reader (_muleShapeWhy): quarantined, bytes kept aside, vault held;
  * a roster that lacks a mule its MAP still files items to - uni-weap here, with Grief filed to it - is quarantined once
    both stores are read (_rosterMapWhy): the delete door takes a mule's filings with it, so the two disagree, and the
    prune drops nothing against them;
  * another tab's write is held to every core locker as well (_rosterCoreWhy) - no tab of this board saves one without.
His real roster - every core locker, his notes, his own mules - reads as before (measured on every ledger snapshot that
holds a roster: all hold the 11 core lockers, and no map names a mule its roster lacks).

WHAT IS DRIVEN: the store door, the boot, the tab sync, the vault module's head (load, the migrations, the hold), the
shipped saveA / saveR and the W6 prune, cut from bible.html, in node. RED_PROOF below. A missing node is the only skip.
