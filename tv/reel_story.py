"""THE REEL'S STORY — where each reel stands, and how much of the film was worth keeping.

Konyo, 2026-09-01: "reels need to be visually connected to the backend coding of the pruning and
optimization and extracting process.. so maybe it can also be visually structured as such within
THE SHELF so its logically showing visually whats happening and needs to happen storyline synced
to the process" — and then: "those filters we mentioned the 10-15% of real footage and the other
70%+ was useless.. maybe that statistically can be also rendering and shown? as the filtering and
routing processes happen? so visually in retrospect we can surgically fix anything out of line".

⚠ THIS MODULE DECIDES NOTHING. Every stage below is read from the code that already decides it —
`reel_retention.plan()` for the verdict, `retro_triage` for the yield. A second opinion about
which reels may go would be a second prune authority, and two authorities disagreeing over
footage that has no un-delete is the worst outcome available here. If a stage looks wrong on
screen, the fix belongs in the decider, not in this file.

THE STAGES, and the function that decides each one:

    FILMED            the reel directory exists                    reel_retention.plan() -> onDisk
    TRIAGED           a structural verdict was recorded            retro_triage.load()
    SWEPT             the chronicle lane read it                   plan(): pages > 0
    BANKED            its rows reached the durable ledger          plan(): tag != rows-not-banked
    VAULT DONE        the vault lane is finished with it           plan(): tag != vault-owes
    RELEASABLE        both lanes done; it may be pruned            plan(): tag == eligible
    PRUNED            gone, tombstoned                             reel_retention._tombstone

A reel that has not REACHED a stage is "not yet" — never "failed". A reel nobody has measured is
UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN is not zero: `yield: None` means nobody surveyed it, `yield: 0.0` means it
was surveyed and carried nothing. Collapsing those two is a lie with no author.
