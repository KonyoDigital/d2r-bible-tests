"""THE CUSTODY RECORD — one reel, every hand that held it, each answer QUOTED from the store that hand wrote.

His vision, 2026-09-28 (HANDOFF §30, task #55): *"think about it like a robot AI vacuum cleaner.. it maps out the
rooms and house and areas it cant go.. same here it needs to map everything out ... witnesses obviously like some
sort of stamping system"*. The item-level half of that (SPOT / TRAIL / CONTEXT, pictures that may LINK from day one
and NAME only once HARDENED, carried loot OWNED right away — his §31 rulings) is phases P1-P5 of
55_CHAIN_OF_CUSTODY_DESIGN.md and is NOT built here. This is the first slice underneath it: the REEL's chain of
custody, because an item's trail is stamped onto frames, frames live in reels, and today nothing can say in one
place who has held a reel.

⚠⚠ WHAT WAS MISSING, MEASURED 2026-09-29 ON HIS TREE (read-only). Five stores each hold ONE fragment of a reel's
custody, keyed three different ways, and nothing joins them:

    reel_tombstones.json   460 rows — EVERY ONE says "sealed by BOTH lanes"
    vault_swept.json        51 seals — only  44 of those 460 have one       (keyed s_<ms>_<n>)
    chronicle_swept.json   431 seals — 404 of the 460 have one              (keyed reel_s_<ms>_<n>)
    retro_triage.json      478 rows  — 445 of the 460 were surveyed         (keyed reel_s_<ms>_<n>)
    river_stamp.jsonl      169 rows  —  50 of the 460 were ever stamped, and 0 stamps say TOMBSTONE
    the shelf               33 reels — 33 stamped · 33 surveyed · 21 chronicle-sealed · 7 vault-sealed

    56 tombstones have NEITHER seal. The permanent record of an irreversible delete names two hands that the
    hands' own records say never touched the reel. `end_routes.derived_from` already counts that as a NUMBER
    (labelContradictions); no surface could show it PER REEL, beside the hands that did hold it.

So this module answers, for one reel, the robot-vacuum question at reel granularity — which rooms did it pass
through, which did it never enter, and which room's record contradicts another's:

    recorder   the shelf directory + the recorder's own reap/refusal records   (tv_diablo writes them)
    triage     retro_triage.json                                                (the FREE structural survey)
    printer    chronicle_swept.json + the reads the journal holds for it       (the chronicle sweep / reader)
    vault      vault_swept.json + the witness index                             (the vault sweep)
    tombstone  reel_tombstones.json + the deleter's CURRENT intent (the plan)   (reel_retention)

=== THE RULES, AND WHY EACH IS NOT NEGOTIABLE =========================================================

1. **EVERY ANSWER IS QUOTED FROM ITS OWNER. NOTHING IS RE-DERIVED.** The four dict stores are read ONCE through
   `end_routes.sources()` (which itself asks `retro_triage._store_path` and `reel_retention._tombstone_path`);
   the seal's meaning is `frame_authority.seal_verdict`; the journey is `river_stamp.history`; the lane at a
   station is `river_walk.LANE_OF_STATION`; who took a picture is `read_pictures.who_took`; the door a tombstoned
   reel left by is `end_routes.verdict`; the capture clock is `reel_router._captured_ms`; every lookup in a
   store keyed both ways is `reel_retention.lookup_either_way`. REG-563/564 were two modules hand-writing the
   same lookup with different precedence. [[copy-drift]] §1: one owner, everyone else quotes.

2. **A HAND IS `held: True | False | None`, AND THE THREE ARE THREE.** True = that hand's own store carries a
   record for this reel. False = the store was READ (present, or never written) and holds none — a measured
   absence, a room the vacuum never entered. None = the store exists and would not read, so whether that hand
   held the reel is UNKNOWN. Collapsing None into False is how "the vault never sealed it" gets said about a
   store nobody could open, and a contradiction is NEVER raised on a None side. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

3. **A CONTRADICTION IS PUBLISHED WITH BOTH SIDES AND NEVER RESOLVED.** Two writers disagreeing about one reel
   is the finding: the deleter's sentence vs the seal stores, the ledger's "removed" vs a directory still on
   the shelf, a hand-stamped TOMBSTONE vs a ledger with no row. Each row names the left writer, the right
   writer and what each says. Averaging them, or trusting the louder one, would hide exactly what he asked
   this map to show. [[feedback-contradiction-is-the-finding]]

4. **THE JOURNEY IS THE RIVER'S, THE CUSTODY IS THE STORES'.** `river_stamp` remembers the stations a reel
   REACHED (position, dated); the hands here are what each store RECORDS. They can legitimately disagree —
   the river cannot stamp TOMBSTONE at all (river_stamp's own note: the deleter does not stamp) — so the two
   are published side by side under different names and never folded into one "status".

⛔ IT READS. IT WRITES NOTHING, DELETES NOTHING, ARMS NOTHING, SPENDS NOTHING. It is #253-honest: it reads THIS
PC's stores only, so the record it hands the console is this install's own custody, never the fleet's.

    python3 tv/reel_custody.py <reel>      # one reel's custody, every hand
    python3 tv/reel_custody.py             # the census — which hand holds each reel, and the contradictions
