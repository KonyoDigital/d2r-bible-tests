"""THE DOM SAID PAINTED, THE PIXELS SAID BLACK, AND NOTHING IN THE CONSOLE COULD HOLD BOTH.

Konyo, 2026-09-07, photographing a black room with the shelf open: *"shelf still obivously your on
it right? its not rendering.. and it should be flagship style"*, then: *"connect it to the heart of
the console too"*.

MEASURED on his live console at that moment, through /api/status:

    shelf   {"open": true, "filled": true, "cards": 3090, "why": null}
    theatre {"open": true, "loaded": true, "painted": true, "ink": true, "why": null}
    hidden true · painting false · frozenBeats 8 · blankStrikes 0

**3,090 shelf cards were built and the console called itself painted, while he looked at black.**

=== WHY EVERY EXISTING GUARD PASSED, AND THIS IS THE POINT ===
The shelf door has been hardened three times for this same complaint, each time moving one step
closer and each time staying on the same side of the glass:

    v2446  the swallowed shelf   -> catch a rejected thOpen so the shelf is still attempted
    v2451  the door toggles      -> clicking it again must get him out
    v2666  "hidden === false IS NOT 'he can see it'" -> prove it from the RECT and the CONTENT

⚠⚠ ALL THREE PROVE THE **DOCUMENT**. NONE OF THEM PROVES **PIXELS**. `painted` and `ink` in the
beat are derived from rects, computed style and text presence — they are DOM measurements wearing
pixel names, and they cannot see a stale composite. So the one failure mode that leaves him staring
at nothing is the one every witness reports as success. This is the fourth round of the same bug.
[[label-outlived-referent]] [[feedback-verify-not-proxy]]

=== WHY THE PIXEL WITNESSES MISSED IT TOO ===
`paint_witness.look()` reads the WHOLE window and returned PAINTED — correctly: the header, the
rail and the footer strip were all lit, only the room was dead. `region_witness` at its shipped
**3x2** grid could not see it either, because over a 1120x660 window each cell is ~373x330 and
therefore **catches a lit edge** (header, footer or rail); all six read PAINTED at ink 0.02-0.07.
MEASURED at increasing resolution on that same dead window:

    grid   painted  blank   blank cells
    3x2       6       0     -
    4x3      12       0     -
    6x4      24       0     -
    8x5      38       2     (1,4) (2,4)      <- the coarsest grid that can see the dead room
    10x6     53       7     ...

⇒ `GRID` is 8x5 because that is where his real fault first became visible, not because it is round.
That is the chrome-contamination shape of v2752 one layer out. [[feedback-suspect-the-instrument]]

=== WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR ===
Neither side alone is evidence. A DOM that says painted is not proof he can see it; a blank region
is not proof of a fault (he may have an empty shelf, or the window may be covered). **The finding is
the DISAGREEMENT**, and this repo's rule for that is to publish both rather than average them.
[[feedback-contradiction-is-the-finding]]

⛔ IT READS AND NEVER ACTS. No relaunch, no repair, no click. `/api/relaunch` under a window he is
using is what produced the original sighting. [[borrowed-surface]]
