"""#294 (REG-2080) - A NAME NOTHING ON THE BOARD KNOWS IS NEVER GIVEN A MULE BY A WORD IN IT; IT STAYS UNSORTED.

His ruling 2026-10-07: an item the board cannot NAME is placed by where the reels saw it, else it stays UNSORTED - "never
a blind default like the weapons mule". GrokBot ticks 420 and 424: 'Bone Visor' (a misread; no catalogue, no base table
entry) was filed in UNI-ARMOR by the word 'visor', tipped 'Base item', and Vault Integrity listed 11 rows and not it.

MEASURED on the real page, main vs this tree, over all 1,363 names the catalogues, set pieces, runewords and base table
know plus the routing fixtures: 8 change, every one a name no catalogue holds (Bone Visor, Quovadis Fnord, Blood Shield,
two magic coronet names with no magicFinds record, and the bare words Ring, Amulet, Grand Charm). A first cut moved a
NINTH - 'Rare Jewel (15 IAS / −15 Req)', a real EXTRA_ITEMS key - because the router's byte fold re-asked with an ASCII
hyphen and returned that answer unconditionally; the fold now asks the original bytes when its repair is Unsorted.

  * the router answers {id:null, unsorted:true, why} when there is no base, no lookup, no ITEM_TIP and no curated entry -
    BEFORE the ARMOR_RE / JEWELRY_RE word guesses and the weapons park;
  * the byte fold falls through on an Unsorted repair;
  * a filing asked of the router refuses 'unsorted' with the router's own reason.
The proposal and the audit halves are driven in node by their own laws (test_the_vault_proposes_a_home_and_does_not_move,
test_furniture_filed_in_a_mule_is_an_integrity_finding); this law pins the router's order, which no stub can show.
REG-2093 (CI Routine I on v3624): a find HE registered in Magic & Rare is known to the board - the router asks that register
before it answers Unsorted, and the AI Item Checker writes it before it asks.
