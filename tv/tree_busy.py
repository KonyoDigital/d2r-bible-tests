"""v3330 (#72) — IS THE TREE BEING GRADED RIGHT NOW? One definition, so nobody has to remember.

His ruling, from the #46 false-alarm incident: "do not write while a gate runs" must be a REFUSAL,
not a habit. The rule is already written down in CLAUDE.md, in regression-guard, and in every
staged apply-script — as PROSE, four times over. Prose is what fails.

⚠ WHY IT MATTERS, and it is not tidiness: `hooks/pre-push` grades the WORKING TREE, not the commit
(REG-1131). A version banked while the gate is mid-run gets a green verdict about bytes that are
not the ones shipping. That is the most expensive kind of wrong answer this repo produces, because
it looks exactly like a correct one.

TWO INDEPENDENT SIGNALS, because each misses a case the other catches:

  1. THE GATE LOCK. `run_gates._claim_the_tree` takes an exclusive flock on
     `<tmpdir>/d2r_gates_<resolved-tree-key>.lock`, keyed on `os.path.realpath(REPO)` so his two
     worktrees never collide. flock deliberately: the kernel drops it when the process dies, so a
     crashed run cannot leave a stale lock that refuses every future one — its own comment says
     "a pid file would need reaping logic, and reaping logic is how a lock starts lying."
     We try the SAME lock non-blocking and release it immediately; failure means a gate holds it.

  2. A RUNNING pre-push HOOK. The hook does more than run_gates — renders, console demos,
     Playwright smoke — and holds the tree across all of it, including stretches where the gate
     lock is not held. Checking only the lock would call the tree free during the smoke.

⚠⚠ ITS REACH, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED. This cannot be forced on an ad-hoc edit. A python
heredoc that writes bible.html directly will never consult a module it does not import, and a
guard that claimed otherwise would read as complete while being optional. What it CAN do is stand
at the one chokepoint every ship passes — `bump_version.py` — so the damaging case becomes
structurally impossible even when the discipline slips. [[the-unjoined-end]]
