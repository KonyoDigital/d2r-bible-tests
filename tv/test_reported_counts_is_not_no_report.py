"""v3169 (#82) — "HAS NOT REPORTED" MUST NOT BE SAID ABOUT A MACHINE THAT REPORTED.

HIS CORRECTION, 2026-09-15. He sent the cross-reference panel reading

    "Dean has not reported which set pieces it holds yet - that is 'we have not heard from
     it', not 'it has none'. It publishes on its next heartbeat."

beside his own fleet card reading **DEAN · SETS 131/135 · UNIQUES 0/403 · RUNEWORDS 98/99**,
and said: *"dean already synced his sets something is regressed here"* and then, with a second
screenshot, *"i m saying that he has it even says it here"*.

MEASURED on his live /api/fleet at that moment - Dean's row carried
`tally.sets {have 131, total 135}` and `maskWhy {'sets': 'no board window'}`, `masks: None`.

SO THE SENTENCE WAS WRONG TWICE OVER:
  1. HE DID REPORT. The counts were on the wire. What was missing is the per-item MASK - the
     bitmask that lets the panel NAME pieces rather than count them. "has not reported" is a
     label that stopped being true of the number printed beside it. [[label-outlived-referent]]
  2. "IT PUBLISHES ON ITS NEXT HEARTBEAT" IS A PROMISE THAT CANNOT BE KEPT. The row already
     said why: no board window on that machine. It will fail identically on every heartbeat
     until one is open. A false "just wait" turns a fixable condition into an invisible one.

AND THE REASON WAS PUBLISHED BUT NEVER READ: `maskWhy` appeared ZERO times in control_ui.html.

    The card was HALF on the scale: .ftt-counts used var(--fs-*)/var(--ls-wide) tokens while four
    sibling rules carried raw letter-spacing literals (.04em x2, .03em, .02em). Three had EXACT
    tokens (--ls-snug .04em, --ls-tight .02em) so swapping them changed nothing visually and made
    the card consistent. The fourth, .03em on .fleet-meta.fleet-word, sat on NO step of the scale
    while its twin — the same verdict word rendered in the tooltip as .ftt-h .ftt-w — was .04em.
    Two trackings for one word, recorded by nobody. Now both are --ls-snug.

    ⚠ A TOKEN SWAP IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY FREE. LOCKED_TYPE_SYSTEM's own warning: an em is not a
    lookup, so replacing one can change the rendered size silently. Three of these were exact
    matches; the fourth is a deliberate 0.01em move, named in the CSS so it is not re-guessed.
