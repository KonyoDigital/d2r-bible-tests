"""v2814 — THE FLEET PANEL SAID "HE HAS NOT REPORTED" ABOUT A MACHINE THAT HAD.

Konyo, 2026-09-09, with screenshots. Two sentences from one panel, minutes apart:

    "the fleet is unreachable — The read operation timed out"
    "Dean has not reported which set pieces it holds yet"

MEASURED against the live beacon in the same minute as the second one:

    Dean   ver=v2745   online=TRUE   masks: sets=76ch, uniques=118ch
                                     tally: sets 128/135, uniques 249/403

He had reported BOTH ledgers. Three separate defects sat behind those two sentences.

1. A FAILED FETCH DESTROYED THE GOOD ANSWER. `fleet_presence()` caches 60s and on a timeout did
   `_FLEET_PRESENCE_CACHE["d"] = out` where `out` is the ERROR — so one 6s timeout replaced a
   roster that was working. The card had already rendered from the cached success; the modal, 60
   seconds wide, got the refusal. Strictly worse than no cache: without it the modal would simply
   have re-tried.

2. A STALE ROSTER WAS TREATED AS AN UNREACHABLE FLEET. The cross-reference refused outright on any
   fetch failure, while the card beside it was rendering that same machine's real numbers.

3. "HE HAS NOT REPORTED" WAS CONCLUDED FROM A CACHE. This is a claim about ANOTHER machine — the
   one kind this console cannot check by looking inward — and it was made from a record that can
   be arbitrarily old when a fetch has failed in between. An absence in a cached record is not an
   absence in the world.

★ THE RULE: serve the last good roster with its AGE rather than an error, and make a miss earn one
authoritative re-read before the sentence is allowed to be said.

        It read `assertIn('"goodD"', self.src)` over the WHOLE of control_app.py. The proof strips
        both slots from the INITIALIZER — the only place their absence matters — and the names go
        on appearing by design in `fleet_presence()` (`_FLEET_PRESENCE_CACHE["goodT"] = now`) and in
        `fleet_presence_last_good()` (`.get("goodD")`). So the substring was found, the law passed,

        repo have been caught in, each staying green through its own defeat because the literal
        occurs more than once on purpose.

        ⚠ AND IT GUARDS SOMETHING LIVE: v2843 built the panel's stale-roster fallback on exactly
        these two slots. A law that cannot see them removed is a law that would have let that
