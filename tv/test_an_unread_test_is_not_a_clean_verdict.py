"""#196 — ci_sim printed "could not be read" and then exited 0 about it.

`unread` was reported above the verdict and ignored by EVERY return: exit 1 on failures, exit 3 on
platform facts, else exit 0 — "no KNOWN host dependency in N test(s)". So a suite whose unreadable
tests all passed produced a clean verdict about work the tool never examined.

⚠ A method added on the class at RUNTIME is unreadable by construction: defining() finds it,
inspect.getfile names the class file, and _source_index only stores FunctionDef nodes that appear
in the class BODY — the AST never had it. So this is reachable, not theoretical.
