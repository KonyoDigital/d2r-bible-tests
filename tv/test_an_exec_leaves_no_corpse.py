"""#224 — AN IN-PLACE RELAUNCH LEAVES NO <defunct> CHILD, AND THE NEXT IMAGE COLLECTS ANY IT INHERITS.

⚠⚠ MEASURED 2026-09-24 (read-only audit of his console): 35 <defunct> `ocr_mac` children under one pid,
exactly one per os.execv relaunch — the warm tv_diablo OCR worker was alive at every exec and the new
image had no handle to wait() it. DRIVEN on REAL processes in a temp dir, never on his console:
a worker quiesced before exec leaves nothing; a child that dies AFTER exec is reaped by the new image
BY PID; and the baseline proves the end-to-end case can tell the two apart. RED_PROOF below.
