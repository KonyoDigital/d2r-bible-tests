"""#213 (REG-2035) - THE BOARD'S HEADLINE IS THE ONE UNIQUES NUMBER; THE MASK ONLY NAMES ITEMS.

HIS RULING 2026-10-07: "the board's uniques headline is THE number; console and fleet card read the board's count,
never re-count." MEASURED 2026-10-08 08:5x on his console (read-only GETs): his board said 326, the cross-reference's
mineN said 327 (the mask unions d2r_owned - Arachnid Mesh, never in d2r_foundLog - over a 398-name roster; the board
counts its own 403-item chronicle universe). And every peer row was re-counted the other way: GrokBot's board, whose
ledger is its OWN (provenance SYNCED), said 308 and the fleet showed its mask's 309, because
_fleet_reconcile_tally_with_masks let the mask win everywhere - a rule written for a SEED (Dean's beacon publishing
Konyo's 249 while its own mask said 0), before REG-1907 could tell a seed from a board's own ledger.

  * a SYNCED row keeps its board's headline; the mask's count rides beside it as maskHave;
  * a SEEDED or unclassified row still yields to its mask (an unclassified tally may still be a seed);
  * his own row (localRead) is untouched;
  * the cross-reference says the board's headline as "yours", and the matched-name count beside it only when the
    two differ.
