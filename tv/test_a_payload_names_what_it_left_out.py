"""v3341 (#97) — A PAYLOAD NAMES THE FILES IT LEFT OUT, NOT JUST HOW MANY CHARACTERS IT CUT.

`payload_for(sha)` declared its truncation as a CHARACTER COUNT — "truncated to 8142 of 16736 diff
chars at a line boundary". True, and unusable. A char count cannot tell the eye WHICH FILES are
missing, so the eye answers "the diff is correct as shown" in perfect good faith about a payload
that contains none of the change under review.

MEASURED 2026-09-19 by rebuilding this function for every version v3300-v3340 and diffing what it
would send against what the commit actually changed (version stamps excluded — they carry no logic):

    versions examined with code changes                36
    versions where a code file NEVER reached the eye   22   (61%)

AND IN SEVERAL, THE DROPPED FILE IS THE VERSION'S ENTIRE SUBJECT:

    v3330  dropped tv/tree_busy.py          the module that version exists to create
    v3315  dropped tv/second_eye_run.py     the file that version exists to change
    v3333  dropped tv/control_ui.html AND tv/test_a_session_card_always_has_a_clock.py
    v3339  dropped its own law

⚠ THE ROSTER MUST COME FROM GIT, NEVER FROM WHAT WAS FETCHED. payload_for asks for *.py first and
appends *.html only if the budget is not already spent, so when the python diff alone exceeds the
cap the html show is NEVER RUN. A dropped .html is therefore not missing from any buffer that could
be compared — it is missing from the QUESTION. Deriving the absent set from the fetched text would
report a confident 0 for exactly the v3333 case that prompted this law. That is why
`absent_from()` shells to `git show --name-only` instead of parsing what it already has.

THREE STATES, AND COLLAPSING ANY TWO IS THE DEFECT:
    a LIST  -> these changed files never reached the eye at all
    []      -> MEASURED AND NONE — every changed code file is in the payload
    None    -> the roster could not be read: UNKNOWN, and NEVER "nothing was missed"

⚠ THIS DOES NOT WIDEN THE PAYLOAD, AND DELIBERATELY SO. v3299 ruled that closing the coverage gap
means a bigger payload, which costs money and is HIS call. That law pinned instead that the runner
STATES ITS OWN REACH. This is the same move one level down: the payload now states which files it
could not carry. [[unknown-stays-unknown]] [[the-unjoined-end]] [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]
