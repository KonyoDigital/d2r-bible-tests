"""THE FLEET MUST NAME WHAT EACH SIDE LACKS — ON HIS REAL ROSTER, NOT A TOY ONE.

Konyo, 2026-09-16, looking at the Dean drill: *"its not showing what dean doesnt have that i have
and doesnt show what we both need still.. which is the cow boots in this case... but in general it
should work not only the cows all of the logic behind it!"*

Two different things were tangled in that screenshot and this file separates them for good:

  · the COMPARE ENGINE — given two published masks, does it put each name in the right column?
  · the PUBLISH path  — did the other machine actually send a per-item list at all?

The engine was never the defect. The panel was on its one-sided branch because Dean's console
published a COUNT and no mask ("no board window"), which is the headless-console state Konyo's own
machine was in the same afternoon. A refusal drawn correctly looks exactly like a broken column,
which is why this pins the engine explicitly rather than trusting a screenshot to tell them apart.

⚠ HIS REAL ROSTER, HIS REAL CASE. A fixture roster would prove the arithmetic and not the join:
the names have suffixes ("Cow King's Hooves (heavy boots)"), and a compare fed bare names matches
NOTHING while every count still looks plausible. Measured — the first version of this check asserted
on "Cow King's Hooves" and could not find it in the roster at all. [[feedback-blind-fixture-green-gate]]

⚠ `neitherHas` MAY BE None AND THAT IS NOT A FAILURE. The server answers null when the roster is not
known to be the whole universe. This asserts the CONTENT only when a list was actually returned, and
never turns a refusal into a confident zero. [[unknown-stays-unknown]] [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]
