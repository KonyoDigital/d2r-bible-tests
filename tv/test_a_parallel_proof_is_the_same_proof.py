"""A FASTER PROVE THAT CHANGES ONE VERDICT IS NOT A SPEEDUP, IT IS A BROKEN GATE.

`heart2.py --prove` was doubly serial — per gate, then per proof — and one proof is "sabotage a
file → run that gate in a subprocess → restore". MEASURED on his pushes: that step was ~24 min of
a 38m42s push and ~26 min of a 41m25s one, 60%+ of every push, with ONE child process alive at a
time and load ~2.2 on a 10-core machine. It was never CPU-bound; it was serialised, and it grows
with every law added.

⚠⚠⚠ THE OBVIOUS SPLIT — one worker per GATE inside ONE SHARED sandbox — IS UNSAFE, and the
measurement is what says so. Taken 2026-09-23 over the whole registry:

    537 gate files readable · 497 declare a red-proof · 1,302 declared proofs
    149 distinct tampered files once resolved · 67 of them claimed by MORE THAN ONE gate
    446 of 497 gates (90%) tamper a file that another gate also tampers
    control_app.py alone: 124 gates tamper it, and a further 110 gates NAME it without
    tampering it — so they would read a neighbour's sabotage and go red for it

Two lanes in one sandbox is a false verdict in BOTH directions. A neighbour's sabotage reddens an
innocent gate, which then reports UNPROVABLE — "it is ALREADY RED untampered" — a sentence that
would simply be untrue. And a neighbour's restore can hand a gate CLEAN bytes at the moment it is
supposed to be judging tampered ones, which reads as PROVEN: a gate credited with catching a
defect it was never shown. Grouping by tampered FILE does not fix it either, because a gate reads
far more than it tampers; that is what the 110 measures.

So the shape is ONE THROWAWAY SANDBOX PER LANE, gates pulled from a shared queue, every proof of
one gate run serially inside the single lane that owns it. This file is the law that the shape
survives: the lanes and the old serial loop must return the SAME verdicts, proof by proof — not
merely "both green" — every gate must come back with a row even when its lane dies, and the
subject file must be byte-exact afterwards, including when the run raises.

⚠ THE SCAR THIS RUNS TOWARD: test_control takes 19.5s idle and 565.9s under concurrent load, a
29x slowdown that once produced a FALSE RED and refused a legitimate push. Parallel proving
manufactures that load on purpose, so the lane count is a named constant that can be turned DOWN
with HEART2_PROVE_WORKERS and never requires an edit on a machine that is already struggling.

    the SERIAL control measured 230.3s for its clean+tampered pair and already reported its OTHER

    any load tips it. A smaller lane count does not help — 2 lanes flips the same proof, measured.
