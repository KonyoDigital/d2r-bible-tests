"""REG-2588 - THE SHARD WORKFLOW RUNS EVERY SHARD 1..N ONCE, AND ITS FAN-IN PASSES ONLY A SET THE IMPORT WOULD TAKE.

.github/workflows/proof-keys-shards.yml cuts one `heart2 --prove --push` across N runners (REG-2585) and a fan-in job
collects their caches for `heart2 --import-shards` (REG-2586). A YAML file is a claim; this law reads it:
  1. N is said once (PROOF_SHARDS) and the matrix is exactly 1..N - a shard number nobody runs is a slice never
     proved, and the import refuses the whole set over it; N fits the Free plan's 20 concurrent jobs;
  2. each shard runs --proof-shard <its number>/N into its OWN fresh cache under RUNNER_TEMP, named as heart2's store
     writer requires, and uploads it (hidden file included) even when the prove failed;
  3. the fan-in needs every shard, runs whatever they concluded, and checks the set with tv/proof_shard.py --fan-in
     against this commit - the same check_shards/select the import applies;
  4. it runs only from ci/proof-keys-* (or by hand), never on main, and no `claude` can answer on its runners.
And the fan-in itself is DRIVEN over temp shard dirs: a whole set passes, a missing / extra-N / other-commit set is
refused, a stopped shard is named with its banked count.
