"""REG-2461 / REG-2462 (#181) — A PC KEEPS ITS OWN SLOWEST REQUEST AND ITS OWN RIVER EPOCH, AND NEVER SHOWS ANOTHER'S.

MEASURED 2026-10-22 (git ls-files, and the code): tv/.status_worst.json and tv/.river_epoch.json are TRACKED, so every
update ships them to every PC. The console read the tracked record as THIS PC's slowest request (_status_worst_load),
published it as `worstRequest`, and kept it as the bar a new request must beat. The committed record is v3404's
1,773,092 ms fleetOrigin request from his Mac, so a fresh PC - Dean's - published his Mac's 29.5 minutes as its own
until something there was slower still, and never recorded a slow request of its own below that. The epoch harness
wrote the tracked epoch file in place (`io.open(p, "w").write(json.dumps(...))` truncates first, so a raise in dumps
left it empty). His doctrine: what a PC shows about itself comes from that PC's own stores; another PC's number is
UNKNOWN here, never shown.

THE LAW, in a fixture world - TV_HIST names this law's own scratch before control_app is imported, and
_fixture_root_for_state() honours it at every call, so his tv/ is never read or written:
  · another PC's record under the tracked name and no per-PC file -> _status_worst_load() is None and the published
    worstRequest is None (nothing measured here yet);
  · a slow /api/status request (status_payload, its network, CLI and git producers stubbed, the agent probe held for
    0.8 s) is kept in the per-PC file and published, and the tracked file's bytes stay identical;
  · the names the code writes - read from the code, with their .tmp - are ignored by git's own matcher in a throwaway
    repo seeded with the tree's .gitignore files (GIT_* scrubbed for these calls, the host's global excludes off);
  · river_epoch.write lands whole: a record it cannot serialise leaves the previous one byte-identical.

REVIEW (major) - THE RECORD IS THE CONSOLE'S, NOT EVERY IMPORTER'S. The first cut let any process that called
status_payload() with TV_HIST unset load and save the record: every law, the pre-push suites, any CLI. With the
tracked 1,773,092 ms bar gone, the first test request over 750 ms became "this PC's slowest request" - the review
reproduced test_a_dead_journal_reader_says_so leaving a 1,141 ms record in the tree, which a fresh import published as
worstRequest; read from the code, the live console loads that file whenever its own in-memory record is None. So,
with TV_HIST unset, the state root repointed at this law's scratch (a law that repoints it is still a law) and the
console path unmarked:
  · a slow status_payload() leaves no record behind - the request is kept in this process's memory only;
  · a record already there (his console's) is not this process's bar and is not published as its own, and its
    bytes stay identical;
  · this PC's console (the console path marked, the primary port) still writes its record and reads it back, while a
    console on a private port and a TV_STUB harness console write nothing.
The tracked files are not deleted in this change: on a PC where one is locally modified (the ALT's ` M`, REG-1837) a
commit that deletes it makes `git pull --ff-only` refuse for good. [[unknown-stays-unknown]] [[the-unjoined-end]]
