"""v3393 — A MACHINE ESTABLISHES ITS OWN TREE, AND NEVER GUESSES WHERE.

His ruling: fix "any machine establishes its own tree", never "the Windows PC", so that Dean's PC is
fixed BY PULLING with nobody touching it.

⚠⚠ THIS GATE CHECKS THE CONTRACT, NOT THIS MACHINE. A case asserting "every root is found" would
pass on his Mac and FAIL on a CI runner, which has no established tree - and the whole point is that
a fresh machine is a LEGITIMATE state, not a failure. Whether THIS machine's tree is established is
the heart's question, and its live red case is his Windows ALT box right now. [[test-venue]]
