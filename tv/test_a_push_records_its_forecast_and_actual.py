"""REG-2352 (#42 R11) + REG-2353 (#42 R16) - NO SILENT PROVE-NOTHING, AND EVERY PUSH RECORDS WHAT IT EXPECTED AND DID.

R11. `heart2.py --prove NAME[5]` matched no gate, printed "nothing to prove" and exited 0: a typo, or a proof index nobody
can ask for, read as a proof that held. hooks/pre-push deletes its prove log the moment heart2 exits 0, so a push that
PASSED left no account of what it proved, reused or re-ran.
R16. `--forecast NAMES` prints, BEFORE any proving, a "#42 FORECAST" block: per law, what the verdict cache will serve
(hit), what the red memory will narrow, what runs in full, and what can never be banked and why (UNKEYABLE) - and never
fails. Every --push run appends a record, per proof the path forecast before it ran beside the path it took, its
verdict and seconds, to a per-machine file outside every work tree (`--pushes` reads it). A proof whose key the cache
would serve when the run began, and that ran anyway, is a PROVE-ONCE VIOLATION in the record.

DRIVEN:
  1. unmatched_names / prove / main: an unmatched name and a `NAME[k]` are said and exit 2, also beside a name that
     matched; a matched run still exits 0.
  2. forecast() over a fixture tree and a fixture verdict cache: a banked proof is a hit, a remembered one narrow, the
     rest full, a law that lists a directory UNKEYABLE with its reason; a cache or a sandbox that raises is UNKNOWN, never
     a raise; `--forecast` exits 0 whatever happens.
  3. the REAL push path (_prove_gate with _PUSH set, a stand-in law run): the record says hit / narrow / full for the
     three proofs, what was banked, and why each ran; a seeded wrongful eviction is a prove-once violation; the seams
     are in it.
  4. main() writes the record with its exit through prove_record, and `--pushes` reads it back after; the writer
     refuses a file not named like its own, trims past its cap, skips a line it cannot parse, resolves a worktree to
     git's common dir, and holds a lock another writer waits on.
  5. ROUND 3 (the review of T2): prove(), the forecast and unmatched_names select gates by ONE predicate, so a root-level
     gate (`--prove visual_lock_invariant.py`) is proven, never silently skipped; and nothing the forecast or the
     run's servable set asks marks an entry used - they ask peek() / _red_peek(), the predicates the serving reads
     lookup() / _red_recall() answer with, never the serving reads themselves (under R4 those stamp usedAt).
  6. ROUND 4 (the review of round 3): 5 asked WHO was called, and the default merge with track T1 puts T1's usedAt mark
     INSIDE peek() and _red_peek() with every law green. Now the EFFECT is asserted, over a REAL verdict cache and a
     REAL red memory (the real _red_key / _red_peek / _red_recall): the servable set, the forecast, the clean wave's
     all-hit check, peek() and _red_peek() change nothing a use could be recorded in - the cache object's own state,
     the red memory's module state, and both files once flushed - and, on a tree whose stores evict by use (T1), the
     serving reads DO mark exactly the entry they served.
