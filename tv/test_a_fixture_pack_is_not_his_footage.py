"""A FIXTURE PACK IS NOT HIS FOOTAGE — it says so, it cannot overwrite it, and it is not a slice.

HIS BRIEF (GB-CLAUDE-GROK-PROFILE-SYNC): *"Elad will upload recorded runs/scenarios over time.
Clear landing place + loader so they appear as SHELF sessions/reels on guest ... Each pack:
enough for Diablo to open SHELF, click a session, exercise reel controls, open VAULT items —
without mutating possession/ledger from guest."*

MEASURED while building this: one of his reels is **196 MB across 153 frames**. A pack of it is
**2.7 MB across 16**, because a regression fixture that moves 196 MB fills the box before the
second scenario lands.

THREE THINGS THIS PINS, each of which was wrong at some point today:

 1. THE FRAMES ARE EVENLY SPACED, NOT A HEAD SLICE. The pack exists so Grok Bot can "exercise
    reel controls". A head slice gives a pack that looks complete and whose scrub bar only ever
    covers the opening seconds — the very control it is there to test.

 2. A FIXTURE SAYS IT IS ONE, AND DOES NOT WEAR THE SOURCE'S ID. ⚠ The first load returned
    `sessionsAdded: 0`. The pack had kept the source reel's sessionId, so the loader deduped it
    against the 419 real sessions already in the mirror and THE REAL 153-FRAME ROW WON. The
    fixture flag never reached the guest, and an eyes-loop would have clicked his live session
    believing it was the staged one — then reported a finding about the wrong footage. A staged
    scenario indistinguishable from real footage defeats the entire point of the guest seat.
    [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

 3. THE LOADER CANNOT WRITE INTO HIS LIVE TREE. A pack may be BUILT from his footage and never
    LOADED into it. Footage has no un-delete.
