"""REG-2590 — THE MAC DRIVER: one commit proved on 16 CI runners while the Mac proves only what CI cannot bank.

    python3 tv/proof_keys_mac.py [--dry-run] [--timeout-min 150] [--final]

  1. PREFLIGHT  the checkout's tracked files equal HEAD (the import refuses anything else), and HEAD's sha.
  2. LOCAL SET  the gates CI cannot bank, from this checkout's bytes (local_gates): a proof that `needs` a capability
                CI_HAS does not name (macOS, the D2R install, ...), or a gate whose PROOF_NEEDS names a path git does
                not track (footage, listings: on the runner it is absent). A gate with any UNKEYABLE proof is not run
                alongside - an unkeyable proof is never banked, so the final push runs it anyway; it is COUNTED.
  3. PUSH       HEAD to refs/heads/ci/proof-keys-<sha12> - that ref and no other (ci_ref refuses anything else). With
                GITHUB_PUSH_TOKEN set, git asks a credential helper that reads the variable itself: the token is never
                on a command line, never in this script's output (mask()), never in a URL.
  4. ALONGSIDE  `heart2 --prove <local gates> --push` starts on this Mac (log: tv/.proof_keys_local.log) and banks
                into this machine's verdict cache while CI runs.
  5. WAIT       the proof-keys-shards run for this sha (by head_sha, never "the latest run"), until it completes; the
                fan-in job must have SUCCEEDED (it passes only a set the import would take, REG-2588).
  6. IMPORT     artifact proof-shards-<sha> downloaded (the API's redirect is followed WITHOUT the token: the storage
                host never sees it), unpacked into a temp dir (no path may leave it), then
                `heart2 --import-shards <every proof-shard-K/.heart2_cache.json>` - all or nothing.
  7. JOIN       the alongside pass is waited for BEFORE the import (both write the verdict cache, and the import needs
                the checkout clean at this sha - re-checked after the join); its exit is said. --final then runs `heart2 --prove --push`, which
                serves CI's and the Mac's banked PROVENs and runs the rest (and REG-2587/2589 run each imported gate
                clean here once).
  8. OWED      (REG-2594) imported is not FULL: every assigned proof CI banked nothing for (ELSEWHERE there, owed a fix
                by a shard that kept going, or never run) and this Mac's alongside pass does not prove is counted and
                said - "FULL" or "PARTIAL: N of M owed" - so a partial set is never mistaken for a whole one.
Exit 0 when the import took a FULL set and the alongside pass passed; 3 when the import is PARTIAL (no --final runs over
it); 2 otherwise. Nothing is merged, nothing goes to main.
