"""THE CHRONICLE COUNTS A SUNDER ONCE — and the roster still knows every form.

HIS RULING, first on 2026-09-05 and again on 2026-09-15 when it came up in the vault:

    v2680  *"yes we have latent of bone break but the chronicle itself is not latent thats just
            the upgraded version of it after we upgrade in hordaic cube.. so for the chronicle
            all sunders 6 of them need to be counted in the chronicle specifically as 1 tally for
            each.. and for the vault that a different story the entire item database should be
            there regardless."*

    v3183  *"each its own.. for chronicle there is only one name for it.. and for items found or
            stashed or items renewed from the hordaic cube these are their own entity in vault
            terms"*

⚠⚠ THIS LAW EXISTS BECAUSE THE RULING HAS ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED, BROKEN, AND REBUILT.

    v2680  honoured it by filtering the six `Latent <sunder>` names out of the ROSTER.
    v2685  reverted that, because the roster is not the chronicle's tally — it is the resolution
           table for the whole board, and removing a name removes the item's CARD, its FARM ROUTE
           and its ART. It also contradicted his earlier v1720 ruling ("add the 11 rotw items to
           the roster"); the Latent charms are among those eleven. 8 CI failures, all self-
           inflicted. The revert recorded the correct diagnosis: *"he wants the item findable and
           openable (roster) AND counted once (chronicle tally). Those are two different surfaces
           and the fix belongs on the tally, not here."*
    v2691  put it on the tally, where it lives now: `_uniItems()` drops upgraded spellings from
           the CHRONICLE universe while `_gUniqueRoster()` keeps all of them.

Nothing gated any of it. A ruling that has already swung twice, with a correct fix and an
incorrect fix that differ by WHICH SURFACE they touch, is exactly the shape that regresses a
third time. So this law pins BOTH halves, because either one alone is the bug:

    FOLDED in the tally   — or he is asked to find the same charm twice
    PRESENT in the roster — or the charm loses its card, its art and its farm route

MEASURED at the time of writing: roster 398 names including 6 `Latent …`; funiScan().total 392.
398 − 6 = 392, and the six BARE sunders survive. chronTotal stays 403, the game's own Chronicle
count, which carries six sunder rows and zero Latent rows — so the game already agrees with him.

⚠ ON READING THE SOURCE. The predicate and the fold are extracted with BOTH ends anchored and
executed in node, so this law tests the SHIPPED behaviour rather than the presence of words that
describe it. A fixed-size window past a region reads as ABSENT and would let this pass on a file
that no longer contains the fold. [[source-reading-guard]]
