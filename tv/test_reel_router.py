"""A7·ROUTE — one station per reel, and the keep-reason may never decide it.

⚠⚠ THE DEFECT THESE GRADE, measured on his shelf 2026-09-05: 40 reels, 29 never read, and the
oldest ten — back to 2026-07-25 — all with zero reads. Not a badly-ordered queue: `vault-owes`
matched 0 of 40 because `_vault_owed_reels()` is first-match-wins and that tag is LAST, so the
reel reader picked nothing, forever, while publishing `owed: 0` like a healthy idle lane. And
`reel_story._stage_of(tag)` derives a reel's STAGE from the RETENTION TAG, so all 40 sat at two of
six stages with four permanently empty.

⚠ NOTHING HERE TOUCHES HIS FOOTAGE. Every case builds synthetic evidence dicts or a temp reel dir;
none reads `frames/hist`. [[feedback-fixtures-never-touch-live-data]]
