"""v2801 — THE REFUSAL PATH WROTE AN 8.6 MB FILE AND THEN LEFT IT THERE.

`_mini_cells_from_live_frame` copies the live frame to a private temp file so the capture cannot
replace it mid-read (v2799, REG-728). That snapshot was created BEFORE the two cheapest refusals in
the function:

    _fd, _snap = mkstemp(...)          # 8.6 MB written
    _sf.write(raw)
    age = time.time() - frame_mt
    if age > 10:  return None, "...stale..."      <- returns, snapshot stays on disk
    try: import vault_corpus
    except:       return None, "..."              <- returns, snapshot stays on disk
    try:   ...lattice / occupancy...
    finally: os.unlink(_snap)

and the comment on that `finally` asserted, in as many words, **"EVERY return above passes through
here"**. Two of them did not. [[feedback-comments-vs-code]]

⚠ THE STALE PATH IS THE COMMON PATH, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT EXPENSIVE. Grok drove this endpoint on
his console and got `"the newest frame is 3124s old"` — the refusal that leaks — over and over. A
button pressed while the capture is off is not an edge case; it is what the button does most of the
time. Every press would have cost one frame-sized file, forever, in a repo that has ALREADY paid for
an ENOSPC once (20.5 GB in four minutes, 2026-09-03).

★ MEASURED BEFORE FIXING: **0 leaked files on his Mac.** Not because the code was right — because
his console still runs v2796 and this rewrite had never executed there. Latent, not manifest. That
number is the whole reason this is a note and not an incident report, and it is also why a source
reading found it when `df` never would have. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]

THE LAW IS BEHAVIOURAL, NOT TEXTUAL. It calls the real function against a real temp tree and counts
the files left in the system temp dir afterwards. A law that merely asserted "the age check comes
before the mkstemp" would pass the moment someone added a THIRD early return below it — and that is
exactly how this defect was introduced in the first place. [[source-reading-guard]]
