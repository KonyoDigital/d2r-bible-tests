"""♥🔒 A SURFACE MAY NOT ARM ITSELF WHILE ITS INSTRUMENTS ARE BLIND.

Konyo, 2026-09-09: *"the lock and everything still derives from the heart and visually seen"*.
MEASURED when he asked: `self_arming.py` and `hover_wilson.py` held ZERO references to heart2. The
Wilson lock and the heart were two systems that never spoke, so a surface could reach its bar and
ARM ITSELF while the gates that would catch its failure were dark — the lock proving the surface
works, with nothing left able to prove the PROOF works.

A Wilson score says "this refused every attack we made". It cannot say "and we would have noticed
if it had not". That second question is the heart's, and it belongs in the same precondition chain
as the upstream check `may()` already runs: proving a surface in isolation proves nothing about what
feeds it, and an instrument that cannot go red is exactly that kind of missing prerequisite.
[[the-unjoined-end]] [[join-gate-heart]]

MEASURED after the join, on the real lock:
    1 BLIND instrument   -> may(printer.stream) False
    unreadable census    -> False   ("UNKNOWN fails CLOSED")
    absent census        -> False
    restored             -> True    (so it is a gate, not furniture)
