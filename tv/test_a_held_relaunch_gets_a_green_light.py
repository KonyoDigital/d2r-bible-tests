"""v3301 — A HELD RELAUNCH MUST FIRE BY ITSELF, AND THE HOLD MUST BE BOUNDED.

Konyo's #38 ruling, 2026-09-17: *"make sure to safegaurd the sweep so it cant relaunch until it
does happen then a green light switch turns it on to relaunch when needed."*

The HOLD already existed on both doors. **The GREEN LIGHT did not** — `_exec_relaunch_soon` read
*"⛔ ABANDON, do not queue"*, so a relaunch refused mid-sweep was dropped and nothing re-fired it.

MEASURED 2026-09-18 from the GrokBot seat's own rows: 8 mandatory relaunches in a day, gaps
84/42/30/21/28/14/40 min against a 60-110 min sweep. The conflict is the NORMAL case, not a corner.

FOUR PROPERTIES, and each fails differently:

  1. IT FIRES when the work finishes — the watchdog half. Without it he must notice and press.
  2. IT IS BOUNDED, from the FIRST ask. ⚠ And the deadline must not be refreshed by a re-ask,
     or pressing the button on a timer keeps a bounded hold alive forever. An interlock with no
     expiry is a recorded scar in this repo; this is that scar wearing a new coat.
  3. UNKNOWN DOES NOT FIRE. `ok=None` means nobody could read the world. An interlock that opens
     on UNKNOWN relaunches into a sweep it merely failed to see. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
  4. ONE DEFINITION OF "IN FLIGHT". The route kept a third copy, and it had ALREADY drifted into
     a worse defect than the one v2178.1 fixed: it appended "ON AIR" from `_agent_mode` alone,
     with no `_agent_alive()` test. `nothing_in_flight` fixed that in v2161 — *"a STALE MODE
     DEADLOCKS IT FOREVER"* — on the automatic door only. So after an agent CRASH the button
     refused forever, and it is the button you press to recover from a crash. [[copy-drift]]

⚠ BEHAVIOURAL FIRST. Three of these are properties of a pure function and are tested by CALLING
it, not by reading it. Only §4 needs to read source, because "nobody keeps a second copy" is not
a question any single call can answer. [[source-reading-guard]] §1
