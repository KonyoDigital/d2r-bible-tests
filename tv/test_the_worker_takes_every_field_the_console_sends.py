"""REG-3080 - THE ROSTER WORKER TAKES EVERY FIELD THE CONSOLE SENDS IN ITS ANSWERS.

REG-2907 (#36, v3837) added `sessions` and `sessionsWhy` to the characters answer on the console side
(tv/console_snapshot.API_FIELDS) but not on the worker's (functions/api/roster.js API_FIELDS), and the worker's apiOk refuses
any field outside its list - and then refuses the WHOLE profile. Measured live on 2026-10-29: the Mac console on v3838 read
"roster would not take this profile: d2r_api_chars_learned is not the console answer it names", so every profile upload
carrying a characters answer was refused and every shadow froze on its last profile. Found by agent-guide while building
REG-3079. The old law (test_shadow_mode_reads_their_console) held only the API NAMES equal, never each name's fields.

This law holds each name's FIELD list equal on both sides, and runs the worker's own storesOk in node on the store the
console's own api_store builds from a full answer - the round trip, not two lists read side by side. RED_PROOF below.
