"""#91 — HIS CHARACTERS LEARN THEMSELVES FROM THE REELS.

Konyo, 2026-09-30, on the Character Builder's "From your characters (class + level)" list: "for character build
based on the reels and character selection it should also learn the character and sync them in automatically after
being witnessed a few times over."

That list was four HAND-TYPED rows in the page source (CHARS: Konyolock Warlock 88, Konyodin Paladin 82 ...). Nothing
ever updated them, so a level he gained stayed unsaid and a character he made never appeared.

MEASURED before building (2026-09-30, his Mac, 30 reels, 14,208 frames):
  · the character-select screen IS filmed — reel_s_1790675069096 opens on it: nine rows, "SOCKET / LEVEL 1 AMAZON",
    "OSENBEICHAN / LEVEL 31 WARLOCK" (title CHAMPION), a LEVEL 81 SORCERESS (title MATRIARCH) under the cursor ...
  · the local OCR CANNOT READ it (the D2R font: tv_diablo.py already records "defeated by the D2R FONT, not by
    resolution"): the list crop came back "LEvEL I BAKBARIAH", "LEVEL. SI Vi*RL•CK" (31 read as SI), "K•NY•Ku>".
    A whole-reel OCR hunt for "Level N <Class>" found NOTHING in 3,051 frames — the instrument, not the footage.
  · and the OCR is no DETECTOR either: shifting the crop 3 pixels swung it from 4 "LEVEL" rows to 1.
  · the PIXELS are: the list panel is flat grey stone — mean saturation 0.036-0.041, brightness 0.36-0.37 on his
    film — while every other screen measured sits far away (title 0.97 sat, Boosteroid queue 0.33, inventory 0.18,
    gameplay 0.11-0.33 at brightness <= 0.24). ~5 ms a frame, so EVERY frame is checked (his visit lasted 2 s).
    The READ is the console's own vision reader, on the panel crop only, and its "screen" answer is the second,
    independent witness: a grey panel that is not the list costs one refused read, never a character.

THE RULE HE ASKED FOR — "after being witnessed a few times over":
  · a VISIT is one stay on the character-select screen (candidate frames within VISIT_GAP_S of each other);
  · a character is LEARNED once it was read on MIN_VISITS separate visits, with a class;
  · its LEVEL is the highest level that MIN_VISITS visits saw it at or above — a level-up is confirmed the next time
    he opens the screen, and a single misread (88 read as 98) never becomes his level: it waits as `pendingLevel`;
  · within one visit the reads are not independent (the same screen), so a visit claims the LOWEST level its reads
    agree on.
PER PC by construction: each console scans its OWN reels into its OWN ledger (tv/.char_roster.json, gitignored), and
the page asks its own console. Nothing here writes a build: the 👤 Characters / builder stores stay manual (#245).

#149 — THE LOBBY NAMES HIM TOO. The create-game screen between games is not the character-select list (the bands
above already refuse it: left val 0.153). A frame that misses the list and matches the lobby bands gets one read of
the whole frame. The answer is a witness row on that character, citing the frame, not a second way to become learned.
The in-game character panel is the same row when a reader says that is the screen. No pixel band was measured for it.
