"""A FUNCTION THAT ANSWERS A QUESTION NOBODY ASKS IS NOT BUILT — IT IS DECORATION.

#100 bucketed 26 verdict-shaped functions: 6 to JOIN, 12 correctly unjoined, the rest unknown.
These are the last two of the six, and both had exactly ONE reference in the whole tree — their
own test. Written, reasoned, tested, and unreachable.

⚠⚠ AND IN BOTH CASES THE LIVE PATH CARRIED THE DEFECT THE FUNCTION WAS WRITTEN TO PREVENT.

`_chron_lane_detail()` says it in its docstring: *"The lane LIST is what the gate scores; this is
what a human is owed when grok is missing. 'You switched it off' and 'there is no Grok CLI here'
are different facts and only one of them is a problem."* Meanwhile BOTH sweep doors refused with a
flat *"the primary (Claude) lane is unavailable"* — the sentence that sends someone reinstalling a
CLI they had deliberately switched off. Measured on this machine the moment it was joined:
`grok: present=false, why="you switched it off (mode=off)"`.

`story_of(state)` says it too: *"A state this table does not know returns its own name rather than
a default … instead of quietly joining PENDING, which is exactly how a retired item comes back to
life."* Meanwhile the ONLY place states are resolved for the page indexed `_SEC[state]` directly
and raised KeyError.

      · `story_of` was called, and the SAME LOOP then did `order[state]`, keyed only from
