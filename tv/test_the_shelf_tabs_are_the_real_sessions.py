"""THE TABS ON TOP OF THE SHELF ARE BUILT FROM HIS REELS, NOT FROM A LIST.

He said it three times, escalating, because it kept not being done:
    "the tabs ontop need updating related to the reels sessions.. not random or outdated like it is"
    "and accorindgly relevant to the sessions"
    "the tabs within shelf on top need a fixing and updating so they represent the real reel
     sessions that its managing"

⚠⚠ AND THE FIRST TIME IT WAS "DONE" IT WAS HALF-DONE, BY ME. v3195 shipped `SHELF_F.station`, the
`st:` toggle branch, the filter clause in the predicate and the `active` flag — every half except
THE BUTTONS. So a complete, working filter sat in the file with nothing on screen able to reach
it. [[plumbing-with-no-tap]] in its purest form: both ends built, never joined, and it looked
finished from the code side.

THE RULES THIS PINS, each of which is what "not random or outdated" actually means:
  1. EVERY CHIP IS EARNED BY A CARD. The row is tallied from `data-station` on the visible cards,
     so a station with no reel gets no chip and the row can never show a stage his footage is not
     in.
  2. THE ORDER COMES FROM THE RIVER. `SHELF_RIVER_ORDER` is /api/river's own station sequence.
     This file already carries that ruling beside the sort selector — *"The station order is NEVER
     hardcoded here ... Two lists of stations is how they drift."* A hardcoded order would also
     silently drop any station reel_router gains. [[copy-drift]]
  3. AN UNMAPPED STATION IS MARKED, NEVER DROPPED. A stage the river order does not name is a
     finding about the router; hiding it makes the row lie by omission.
  4. AN EMPTY ROW HIDES ITSELF. Nothing stamped means the river has not answered — not that no
     stations exist. [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]
