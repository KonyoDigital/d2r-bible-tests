"""#172 — HIS RULING 2026-09-25: SWITCHING VIEWS CLOSES THE THEATRE.

The theatre deliberately covers every non-Sessions view while it is open. The seat's "freeze" on #230 was never a
paint freeze: its driver reopened the theatre, went to the Vault, and what covered the vault was the theatre's own
film stage (THEATRE_FILM_STAGE; a «-back close returned the shelf at ~184k). Asked, he ruled: switching views
should close it. Measured on a scratch console with fixture film: open -> click Vault -> TH.open false, #theatre
hidden, body.theatre-open gone; clicking the tab already showing leaves it open.

  · DRIVEN (node, the SHIPPED guard cut from the header-tab handler, with a stub TH/thClose): a different tab
    closes an open theatre; the same tab, or a closed theatre, calls nothing.
  · JOINED: thClose is exported on window beside thOpen, which is how the handler reaches it.
  · The browser half runs on CI in tests/v877_rinse.spec.ts against a real console with film.
RED_PROOF below.
