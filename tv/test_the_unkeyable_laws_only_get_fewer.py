"""REG-2363 — THE LAWS WHOSE PROOFS CAN NEVER BE SAVED MAY ONLY GET FEWER.

⚠ WHAT IT COST. heart2 banks a PROVEN only under a byte key, and a law it cannot key is proved from nothing on every
push it is in. MEASURED 2026-10-21: 85 of 1,001 laws were unkeyable (tonight's census, d2r_session_carry), and among
them test_control - 27 proofs at ~4 min each, re-run on every push of the v3783 series, never once saved - because
the file listed directories at 40 sites, 23 of them its own temp dirs and one a glob nothing called. Nothing said a
law had become unkeyable; the cost only ever showed up as a slower push. REG-2362 made test_control and test_agent
keyable; this stops the next one from arriving silently.

THE RULE IS heart2's OWN, asked of heart2 - never a copy: heart2.law_inputs over every registered gate file
(heart2.gate_files), exactly as the push's key_for asks it, plus the one fact a filesystem cannot answer the same way
in every venue: a PROOF_NEEDS under a directory safe_copy never carries (.git, frames - "history and footage are never
hashed") can never be keyed - in the sandbox it is a directory wherever the push starts (from a worktree a private
clone since REG-2364), while law_inputs over a worktree reads the one-line pointer FILE and would call it keyable. The
verdict is MEMBERSHIP against tv/unkeyable_laws.json: a law unkeyable now and not listed fails, naming why; a listed
law that is keyable again fails until it is removed; and the list may not be longer than CEILING below, so growing it
is an edit to this law, made on purpose and re-proved at push - never a quiet line in a data file.

# The proving sandbox carries gitignored runtime files (151 in his tv/), and a listed directory's gitignored entries are not
# key material. A run that OPENS or STATS one is never banked (heart2) - so the only thing the key cannot see is a law that
# reacts to a gitignored name's PRESENCE or COUNT without reading it. This census reads every traced law's listing calls,
# takes the filter each one applies (a glob's pattern, or the endswith / startswith constants of the loop it feeds), and
# tests it against a name for every .gitignore pattern. A listing with no filter, or one whose filter can match a
# gitignored name, must be in EXPOSED with the reason it is safe - so a new law that counts every entry is named here
# instead of slipping into the floor.
