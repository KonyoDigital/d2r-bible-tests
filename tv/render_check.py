"""LOOK AT THE PIXELS — the render loop, coded so it does not depend on me remembering it.

Konyo, after the third time he had to tell me something did not render: "make sure its coded as a
loop full set complete so going forward you can visually check and i dont need to keep telling you
after you say its fixed something doesnt render :)"

He is right, and the reason is not laziness — it is that every failure mode here LOOKS LIKE A PASS
unless the harness refuses. Every rule below is a mistake made in this repo, most of them today:

  ⚠ A ZERO-SIZE ELEMENT CANNOT BE CLIPPED, so "0 clipped" on a hidden panel is a FALSE GREEN.
    Measured 2026-08-28: a vault probe reported {widths:["0"], clipped:0} because the tab was never
    activated. Every card was 0x0 and the harness called it clean. Zero-size is now a REFUSAL.

  ⚠ A BLACK CAPTURE IS A REFUSAL, NOT A SCREENSHOT. Same morning: a clip of a real, populated card
    came back solid black (deviceScaleFactor/clip mismatch — chrome-cdp-mac lists two ways this
    happens). A black PNG is indistinguishable from an empty panel, so the harness measures the
    image and refuses rather than handing over a plausible rectangle.

  ⚠ LOG THE TEXT BESIDE THE CAPTURE. It is the only thing that separates "the panel is empty" from
    "my crop is wrong", and it has settled two wrong diagnoses.

  ⚠ INERT ELEMENTS ARE NOT UNREACHABLE ONES. A rect-based sweep that ignores opacity:0 /
    pointer-events:none reported 27 dead links that all worked, and later a whole "unclickable
    column" that was a closed nav panel. Reachability skips inert nodes before it complains.

  ⚠ RENDER NARROW AND BREAKPOINT-ADJACENT. A grid died at 901px — one pixel above its rule — while
    every check at 900 and 1600 stayed green for a month.

  ⚠ AND A SKIP IS NOT A PASS. No Chrome, no browser, no target found: the verdict is UNKNOWN and it
    exits non-zero. A gate that quietly does nothing is the defect this whole file is a reaction to.

Usage:
    python3 tv/render_check.py                 # every registered target
    python3 tv/render_check.py vault inbox     # just these
    python3 tv/render_check.py --list
Shots land in tv/.render_shots/ (gitignored) so a human can look at what the harness judged.

# MEASURED 2026-09-23, and this is the failure it exists to name. The v3434 push rendered target 1
# of 20 (`advanced`, green at all six widths), then went silent. hooks/pre-push killed the gate at
# its 300s bound and printed `render HUNG` — a sentence that names no link — and the kill took the
# shared Chrome on :9224 down with the process group, so `crest-loudness` then refused with "no
# Chrome on :9224". ONE stalled read, reported as two failures and diagnosed as neither.
# `send()`'s own comment already knew the shape: "a native dialog blocks the renderer AND every
# Runtime.evaluate with it; the socket just goes quiet, which reads exactly like a crashed tab".
#
# WHY 90s, stated so the next reader can re-derive it rather than trust it:
#  · the whole 20-target set rendered green in 248s on an idle Mac, ~2s per target-width, and a
#    target-width is already SEVERAL CDP round trips — so 90s is ~45x the observed cost of a unit
#    of work that is itself bigger than one call. No legitimate single reply is near it.
#  · it must sit BELOW hooks/pre-push's render bound (300s) by enough that the gate can REPORT a
#    stall and move on instead of being killed mid-verdict with nothing said. A bound above the
#    thing that kills you is an absent detector.
# ⚠ It is a bound on ONE read, not on the run: every event that arrives (an exceptionThrown, a
# dialog) is a live socket and resets the next read's clock. A page throwing steadily is answering.

#     one stalled read                        90s     (_CDP_READ_TIMEOUT)
# 264 + 90 = 354 > 300. So even with v3436's short-circuit — one stall costing ONE bound instead
# of four — a socket that goes quiet on the LAST target is still killed mid-verdict and still
# prints `render HUNG`, a sentence that names no link. The short-circuit fixed N x T. It could not
# fix the fact that T is spent at the END of an already-expensive run.
#
# ⚠ AND THE OBVIOUS FIX IS THE SAME DISEASE POINTING THE OTHER WAY. Lowering _CDP_READ_TIMEOUT
# until it fits (300 - 264 = 36s) turns a legitimately slow single CDP call into a false UNKNOWN,
# and an UNKNOWN nobody believes is worse than a hang somebody investigates. Raising the hook's
# bound is worse again: a ceiling above every real load is an absent detector.
#
# So the bound on ONE READ is CLAMPED BY WHAT IS LEFT OF THE RUN. Early there is room for the full
# 90s; at the end there is not, and a bound larger than the time remaining before the killer fires
# is not a bound at all — it is a promise to be killed. A healthy run never notices: its reads

    set before the poll can come round again.

    # ⚠ v2440 — A `locks` TARGET WAS WRITTEN AND WITHDRAWN, AND SAYING SO IS THE POINT.
    # The vault lock chip (#lock-vault, added v2438) has NO TARGET here, so it is UNMEASURED — and
    # in a green run unmeasured reads exactly like clean. That is a real gap, named rather than
    # hidden. What was tried and why it was pulled:
    #
    #   · the chip IS correct, measured directly over CDP at 1120x628:
    #       171.0 x 19.6 · data-state="unproven" · text "locked untested" · every ancestor visible
    #   · but the target could not be made to ACTIVATE reliably, and a gate that always refuses is
    #     furniture in the same way one that always passes is. Shipping it would have trained us to
    #     skim its refusal, and then the real one goes with it.
    #
    # TWO THINGS IT FOUND BEFORE IT WAS PULLED, both kept:
    #   1. the chips shipped `hidden` and only appeared after a status poll — so before the first
    #      poll, or if none ever lands, the lock was INVISIBLE. An absent badge reads as NO LOCK,
    #      which is the one direction it must never fail in. They now ship data-state="locked".
    #   2. AN ACTIVATE IS POLLED, SO IT MUST BE IDEMPOTENT. check() re-runs it every 0.4s for 12s;
    #      an unconditional tab click TOGGLES, so each poll undid the last and the answer came down
    #      to parity. Any future target here must check before it acts.
    #
    # ⚠⚠⚠ v2785 — A `shelf` TARGET WAS WRITTEN AND WITHDRAWN, AND SAYING SO IS THE POINT.
    # Task #30 is real and stays open: THE RIVER STRIP HAS NO PIXEL COVERAGE. v2773 fixed its
    # heading at 375px — three anonymous flex items each wrapping into its own column, the FIFO
    # qualifier crushed into a 61px column three lines tall — and the only thing guarding that fix
    # is a unit test reading computed style. A surface nobody photographs is a surface whose next
    # regression is found by Konyo. That gap is NAMED here rather than hidden, exactly as the
    # `locks` target above is. [[visual-regression-detector]] [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
    #
    # WHY IT WAS PULLED — the last refusal, which is a fact about the SURFACE and not the target:
    #
    #     🔴 shelf  the page never settled in 25s — readyState/size kept moving
    #
    # Opening the shelf keeps the document assembling past the settle bound. That is the same
    # shape as task #15 ("THE SHELF builds ~72,700 DOM elements in one open and stops the whole
    # window painting"); v2760 narrowed the build to what is shown, and it still churns enough
    # that `settled` never latches. A target that always refuses is furniture in the same way one
    # that always passes is — ship it and we learn to skim its refusal, and then the real one goes
    # with it. Konyo's call, 2026-09-08: *"withdraw the target if it refuses again"*.
    #
    # ⚠ FIVE THINGS IT FOUND BEFORE IT WAS PULLED, ALL KEPT AND ALL REAL:
    #   1. `spec["seed"]` RAISED rather than skipped, so adding any target with nothing to seed
    #      printed `🔴 the GATE ITSELF raised (KeyError: 'seed')` and lost the surface. Now
    #      `spec.get("seed")`. That one is shipped and is a fix to the harness for every future
    #      target, not just this one.
    #   2. `serve: True` is what separates a CONSOLE target from a bible.html one. Without it the
    #      shelf was being driven against the public page, where `#th-shelfov`, `#btn-shelf`,
    #      `_toTVD` and even `data-view` simply do not exist. Four rounds of my inference chased
    #      symptoms on the wrong document. [[copy-drift]]
    #   3. `#btn-shelf` is the door, NOT `#th-shelf`: the latter lives inside the theatre bar and
    #      `#th-shelfov` is inside `#theatre`, which is display:none while shut. v2446 wrote
    #      `#btn-shelf` precisely because the shelf was "swallowed" without `await thOpen()` first.
    #   4. PROVE IT FROM THE RECT, NOT THE FLAG — v2666's scar, which applies here verbatim:
    #      "`hidden === false` IS NOT 'HE CAN SEE IT' ... the overlay reported height 0 with the
    #      full refusal text inside it".
    #   5. `activateWhy` IS NOT OPTIONAL FOR A NEW TARGET. Four refusals in a row each said only
    #      "could not be ACTIVATED"; I inferred a cause, fixed something genuinely broken, and got
    #      the same sentence back. The first run WITH `activateWhy` printed
    #      `view=null · _toTVD=undefined · btnShelf=NO · ov=ABSENT` and settled it instantly. A
    #      refusal that cannot name its own cause costs a round every time.
    #      [[zero-needs-a-denominator]] [[feedback-verify-not-proxy]]
    #
    # ⚠ THE NOTE ABOVE IS ANSWERED, v2795 — AND THE ANSWER WAS PRECEDENT, NOT NEW MACHINERY.
    # It said re-registering `_shelf_activate()` needs "a `settle_shape` that tolerates a growing
    # document, or a shelf that stops building", and warned against simply widening the bound.
    # Neither was required. MEASURED across this file's targets: every one of the NINE live-console
    # surfaces — console, state-panel, heart, heart-fan, locks, advanced, advanced-shadow,
    # advanced-fleet, console-tabs — already declares `settles: False` with a `warmup`, because
    # "a live console never stops moving". Proving stillness is the wrong question on this page and
    # the file already knows it.
    # ⛔ AND `settles: False` IS NOT A WEAKER TEST HERE, because the arrival proof lives in
    # `activate` and is stricter than a settle: it refuses until #th-shelfov is unhidden AND has a
    # non-zero RECT (v2666's scar — the overlay reports height 0 inside a shut #theatre while
    # holding its full text) AND the river has actually painted, accepting `.shr-bad` so a console
    # whose river ask FAILS is still photographed rather than being unreachable. That is the exact
    # shape the settle comment itself endorses: "a target that measures a document rather than a
    # widget states its own arrival test in `activate`, which runs separately and CAN fail".
    # ⚠⚠ `_shelf_activate()` STAYS UNREGISTERED — AND THE BLOCKER IS NOW MEASURED, NOT GUESSED.
    # The old note here said it needed "a `settle_shape` that tolerates a growing document, or a
    # shelf that stops building". That was not it. v2795 built the target, ran it, and the numbers
    # say something else entirely:
    #     the DOOR is fine now      clicks=2 · theatre=open · th-shelfov=present+shown · rect=1044x906
    #     the ROUTE is fast          /api/river 0.18s over HTTP; reel_router.route() 0.2s over 40 reels
    #     the machine is fine        load 3.92 on 10 cores
    #     and yet                    shr-wait=YES · says: "reading the river…" past a 12.3s poll
    # So the strip is never ASKED. `_shRiverLoad`'s caller sits behind the shelf's card render, and
    # `_shSort()` returns early when there is no `.sh-grid` — in the harness's sandbox world the
    # grid the river branch depends on is not there to reach. A target that cannot be satisfied by
    # the fixture is [[feedback-blind-fixture-green-gate]]: registering it would ship a permanently
    # red gate, and widening its bound would ship a permanently UNKNOWN one. Both are furniture.
    # ⇒ WHAT REGISTERING IT NEEDS: a seeded shelf in the sandbox (sessions.jsonl is already in
    #   render_check's copy list, so the reels exist — what is missing is the grid actually being
    #   built for them), or the empty-world path resolving the strip instead of leaving it
    #   "reading". The staged target block is kept verbatim in the v2795 notes so the next attempt
    #   starts from the working door rather than rebuilding it.
    # ⚠ THE WORK THAT DID LAND IS IN `_shelf_activate` ABOVE AND IS NOT REVERTED: the one-shot
    #   click became a bounded retry (a one-shot that misses is a permanent refusal wearing a slow
    #   one's clothes), the `_toTVD()` route-out no longer hides behind a `data-view` attribute a
    #   freshly served console does not have, and the whole chain is now instrumented so the next
    #   refusal names its own cause instead of costing a round.

    # Konyo: "skills loaded? how come you didnt use our visual harness gate? you should have
    # caught this already 3 times back.." He is right, and the reason is measurable rather than
    # forgetful: every target here rendered bible.html, and every control he has gone looking for
    # — MINI, MINI(AUTOMATIC), the farm gate, the lamps — lives in tv/control_ui.html. Five
    # targets, zero coverage of that file. The gate could not have caught it.
    #
    # This target asserts the CONTROLS HE REACHES FOR ARE ON SCREEN AND NOT BURIED. It is not a
    # prettiness check: `sel` names the action row, so a control that gets moved back inside a
    # collapsed <details> stops being painted here and the gate says so.
    # ⚠⚠⚠ THE PAGE ITSELF, AND IT IS HERE BECAUSE EVERY OTHER TARGET IS A NAMED SUBTREE.
    # Measured 2026-09-05: all eleven selectors below name specific nodes — `console` is
    # `#btn-mini, #btn-miniauto`, so its `painted 1/1 · clipped 0 · off 0 · covered 0` was a
    # statement about ONE BUTTON and was never a claim about the page. A cold second-eye read of
    # the 375px screenshot found `ON AIR`/`MINI` stacked with text cut off, the AI reads bar
    # rendering "appea / here", and "Failed to fetch" sliced mid-word — every one confirmed by
    # eye, and every one OUTSIDE all eleven selectors and therefore structurally invisible to this
    # harness. A gate reporting clean on a page with visible clipping is [[regression-guard]]'s
    # SAMPLE ≠ VERDICT landing on the visual gate itself. [[visual-regression-detector]]
    #
    # ⚠ `body > *`, NOT `body *`. The probe expands each matched node to `[e] + e.querySelectorAll('*')`,
    # so matching every element would walk every subtree once per ancestor — O(n²) on an 11,806-node
    # document. Matching the top-level containers covers exactly the same nodes ONCE.

        #     unchanged tree reports 5 in one world and 6 in another. A floor over an undefined world
        #     is not a floor; it is whatever was in localStorage the day it was written.
        #   · The seed above now pins the owner world, and the result is STABLE: two consecutive

    # ⚠ WHY THE CONSOLE'S DATA-DRIVEN SURFACES ARE NOT TARGETS HERE, AND IT IS A GAP, NOT A CHOICE.
    # This harness loads `file://` (see _Tab below). That is right for bible.html, which builds
    # itself out of localStorage — every target above seeds a store and the page renders. It cannot
    # work for the console's own panels: THE SHELF, the pipeline board, THE FLEET and the stat strip
    # are all filled from /api/sessions and /api/status, so under file:// they render "Loading
    # runs…" and nothing else. A target for them would refuse on EVERY run, and a gate that can
    # only ever be red is switched off inside a week — the same defect as one that is green forever.
    #
    # MEASURED 2026-09-01 while adding targets for gh #207: a `tvd` target was written, ran, and
    # correctly refused with "the panel could not be ACTIVATED". The refusal was the harness working;
    # the target was the mistake.
    #
    # So those surfaces are covered by driving a PRIVATE console over http on an ephemeral port
    # (never :17772) with CDP, which is what verified task 143 on real pixels. Closing this gap
    # properly means teaching this harness an optional http origin per target — filed, not faked.
    # A surface with no target is UNMEASURED, and unmeasured must never read as clean.
    # ══ v2428 — THE ADVANCED DRAWER, ON PIXELS. Konyo, 2026-09-02: "the Advanced setting i
    # suddenly cant see the advanced grok eyes and the fleet. it slike hidden.. make sure this is
    # watchdogs control too.. visually pixel wise and backend". The backend half is
    # tv/live_panel_gate.py reading uiBeat.advFill; this is the pixel half, and it needs BOTH
    # because they fail differently: the beat can say a drawer filled while it renders as a black
    # column, and this can photograph a drawer that is laid out perfectly and carries placeholder
    # copy. Neither instrument is the other's proof.
    #
    # ⚠ IT MUST BE SERVED. Under file:// the fleet is a fetch to /api/fleet that cannot resolve, so
    # the drawer renders its "unreachable" branch and a target would refuse on every run — the
    # exact mistake the note above says a `tvd` target already made and got deleted for.
    # ══ v2539 — ♥ THE HEART, ON PIXELS. Konyo, 2026-09-04: "connect it to the heart of the
    # console that way we would have caught it". A reading joined to the heart payload and never
    # photographed is half a join: `deadFields` can be perfect in /api/heart and render as nothing
    # at all, which is exactly how a section comes to exist only in the backend. This panel has had
    # sections added to it for twenty versions with no target watching any of them.

               All FOUR chips exist and all four carry a real state. `lock-vault` measures 0x0

                   the v2443 defect — the mini-auto padlock was moved inside a <b> that _miniLbl
                   rewrites with textContent every poll, so it existed for a fraction of a second
                   at load and was then destroyed for ever. A count catches that; a rect cannot,
                   because a destroyed node has no rect to be wrong.
                 · COLLAPSE is asked only of the chips actually on screen, marked below so `sel`
                   names them without hard-coding an id that rots when the panes are rearranged.

               A chip with NO state is the dangerous direction and is refused here: the UI paints
               a missing badge as `locked`, so an absent state reads as a LOCK THAT IS OPEN.

                   created, and the poll then hunted for an element nothing had made. `thShelf`
                   with an explicit `true` is idempotent BY DESIGN (its own note: "always SHOWS"),
                   so the guard bought nothing and cost the whole target.

               ⚠ THIS IS A HARNESS DEFECT, NOT A PRODUCT ONE. The same shelf, probed directly,

               Two defects, and this block warns about one of them two lines above while
               committing the other.

               (1) `thOpen()` IS ASYNC and this re-invoked it every 0.4s. The door awaits it
                   (`await thOpen()`); here it was called and its result checked on the NEXT LINE,
                   so the check always failed and the next poll called it again. Measured: called
                   ONCE and left alone, the theatre is open 4s later. Driven at 0.4s it ends
                   CLOSED — thirty overlapping opens toggle it shut. The comment above says
                   "it must never toggle" about `thShelf` and nobody applied it to `thOpen`.

               (2) `thShelf(true)` WAS SKIPPED WHENEVER THE OVERLAY WAS ALREADY UNHIDDEN — and
                   `thOpen()` unhides it. So the shelf BUILDER never ran, `#sh-lanes` was never
                   created, and the poll then hunted for an element nothing had made. `thShelf`
                   with an explicit `true` is idempotent BY DESIGN (its own note: "always SHOWS"),
                   so the guard bought nothing and cost the whole target.

               ⚠ THIS IS A HARNESS DEFECT, NOT A PRODUCT ONE. The same shelf, probed directly,

               read 18 cards the same afternoon. The gate was red about itself.

               SYNCHRONOUSLY inside that same innerHTML string; only the async surface could not.

               ⚠ THE FILE'S OWN COMMENT SAYS "it must never toggle" AND CALLS THIS IDEMPOTENT.
               `thShelf(true)` always SHOWS — that is not the same as leaving the DOM alone, and
               v3113 removed the old guard for the opposite reason (the builder never ran). Both
               readings are half right: build ONCE, then never touch it again.

               ⚠ THE SENTINEL IS SET AFTER THE CALL, never before — that is the v3122 lesson from
               `__rcTheatreAsked`, which latched to 1 and then threw, making one failure permanent.

               unconditional whenever the click path runs.

         it is this instrument disagreeing with itself.

    `.notes`. My first cut of the declared-floor work put both kinds in one list and had the CALLER
    sniff for a `ⓘ` inside the message to tell them apart — so a gate's block-or-allow decision
    depended on detecting a character in prose, which is the same class of fragility as a guard
    that greps its own comments. Found reviewing my own pushed bytes. The split is structural now:
    a caller that treats the return as "the refusals" is simply right, and `.notes` is there for
    printing. It is a `list` subclass, so every existing caller and every existing assertion —
    `== []`, `len(...)`, iteration — keeps working unchanged. [[source-reading-guard]]

    It waits for readyState complete and the body to stop growing, which its own docstring
    correctly calls the difference between measuring a page and measuring a page still
    assembling. But several targets here are filled by data that arrives AFTER the body has
    stopped moving — the Task Force rows and the vault mules among them — so the document can be
    perfectly settled while the panel this run is about is still empty.

    What followed the activation was `time.sleep(1.4)`, i.e. the exact fixed sleep _settled was
    written to replace, one step further down the same function.

    MEASURED, 2026-08-31. Eight consecutive runs on an idle machine: 8 green. Four runs with one
    extra console process alive: 1 green, 3 RED — and every failure was
    `selector ... matched NOTHING`, never a layout fault:

        901x900   selector '.vm-gauge, [data-vault-mule]' matched NOTHING
        1440x1000 selector '#sc-taskforce .sc-tf-row, #sc-taskforce > .sc-card-h' matched NOTHING

    So the gate was not a coin flip. It was deterministic given a condition nobody was measuring,
    which is worse, because "run it again" made it green and taught us to do that.

# ══ THE COVERAGE RATCHET ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Every other refusal in this file is about ONE reading being wrong. This one is about the SET of
# readings getting smaller, which no single reading can see. `console` went 3/3 to 2/2 when a
# control was hidden, and the run stayed green because two clean measurements are two clean
# measurements — the missing third left no trace anywhere.
#
# Shape, deliberately the same as tv/swallow_census.py's RANK-1 ratchet so there is one idea here
# and not two, but INVERTED: that one counts a defect and may only fall; this one counts COVERAGE
# and may only rise. A drop is a refusal naming the target, the width and both numbers.
#
# ⚠ IT RECORDS `found`, NOT `painted`. `painted` is a verdict about the nodes and moves for honest
# reasons — a legitimately hidden node paints zero. `found` is how many nodes the selector matched,
# which is the question "is this surface still here at all". Ratcheting a verdict would fail every
# time a panel is correctly empty; ratcheting the census fails when a surface goes missing.
#
# ⚠ AND IT IS BLESSED ONLY FROM A CLEAN RUN. A run where the browser went away mid-render must
# never be allowed to write a lower floor — that is how "the machine was busy once" becomes the new
# normal and the coverage quietly halves. `--bless` refuses unless every target reported.
COVERAGE = os.path.join(HERE, "render_coverage.json")


#: ⚠⚠ TARGETS WHOSE NODE POPULATION IS LIVE AND LEGITIMATELY VARIES. A coverage ratchet over
#: one of these is measuring the weather, not the product.
#:
#: MEASURED 2026-09-17, `advanced-fleet` at 1120x628, on ONE unchanged tree within one hour:
#:     13 nodes (twice, during a pre-push, both times blocking a ship)
#:     14 nodes (twice, idle)
#:     15 nodes (three times, idle, later)
#: The differing node was his own fleet row, whose TEXT carries a live status clause
#: ("konyo-3 · no board window"), and the ratchet keys on text — so the clause appearing or
#: leaving reads as a node vanishing. The target serves the REAL console on purpose (its own note:
#: "it can only ever photograph a REACHABLE fleet"), so the population is however many machines
#: have beaconed lately. That cannot be ratcheted.
#:
#: ⚠ THIS IS NOT A SKIP AND IT DOES NOT SILENCE ANYTHING. The RENDER half still blocks for these
#: targets — clipping, off-screen, covered, broken images, failure to activate. Only the
#: population COUNT stands down, and it still PRINTS with both numbers, because an exemption
#: nobody can see is the truncation `regression-guard` names. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
#:
#: ⚠⚠ #157 — AND `shelf-cards`, THE SECOND AND LAST THIS SET MAY HOLD (test_render_coverage caps it
#: at two, and this is the diff that argues for it). Its grid is HIS REELS on the REAL console — its
#: seed stubs nothing — and one selector has photographed three populations: 533 cards at v3051, a
#: floor of 16 blessed later, 48 measured on 2026-09-23. Reels are pruned (his tombstone ledger holds
#: 455) and added, so a floor over that grid is the reel count wearing a coverage label: it refused
#: nothing real and read 32 nodes of "slack" the ratchet never had. What STILL refuses for it: every
#: render check, a width with no reading at all (the `is_ is None` branch below), and a surface that
#: draws nothing ("selector ... matched NOTHING" in the render half). The LAYOUT stays pinned; only
#: the POPULATION stands down.
