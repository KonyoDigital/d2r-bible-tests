"""AN ORGAN THAT COULD NOT LOOK MUST NOT REPORT WHAT IT WOULD HAVE SEEN.

Three sites in the supervision layer turned a failed read into a confident measurement. The
swallowed-exception ratchet had been red on them across **at least ten CI runs**, back to
2026-09-15, naming all three by file and count — `74 -> 77`. The number was correct and nobody
read it, which is its own lesson about a gate whose red becomes furniture.

**1. `heart_map._read()` returned `""`.** `surfaces()` runs the id regex over that string, so an
unreadable `control_ui.html` yields an EMPTY SET — and `render()` would write, into the file the
pre-push gate compares against the tree:

    | surfaces the console paints | **0** |
    | of those, watched           | **0** |
    | coverage                    | **0.0%** |

A heart map stating the console paints nothing, **banked into the repo**, from a failed open. The
organ built to notice blindness would have gone blind in exactly the shape it exists to catch.
Measured for real: 356 surfaces, 8 watched.

**2. `shelf_corroborate._live_sessions()` returned `[]` for both "no sessions" and "could not
ask"** — and its docstring approved of it: *"or return [] with nothing invented."* Nothing IS
invented; that is the problem. A console that is down and a console with nothing on it produce the
same `checked 0, disagreed 0`, so a witness that could not be reached reads as a clean sweep.

**3. `control_app` published `blobs: [], blobsN: 0` when the grouping RAISED.** The reason did
travel in `blobsWhy`, but anything counting blobs read a confident zero from a failed call.

⚠ A WATCHER THAT CANNOT BE READ IS THE WORST OF THE THREE, because it makes every surface it
covers look UNWATCHED — a coverage collapse that reads as a real one. `watched()` now names the
missing watchers instead of silently contributing an empty string.
