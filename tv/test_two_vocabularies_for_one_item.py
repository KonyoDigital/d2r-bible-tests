"""TWO VOCABULARIES FOR ONE ITEM — the vault counts things, the chronicle counts entries.

HIS RULING, 2026-09-15, answering whether a `Latent X` sighting witnesses a bare `X` vault row:

    *"each its own.. for chronicle there is only one name for it.. and for items found or
     stashed or items renewed from the hordaic cube these are their own entity in vault terms"*

MEASURED ON HIS OWN LEDGER when this was written — both errors were live at once:

  FOLDING TOO MUCH   `Latent Black Cleft` (40 sightings) and `Latent Rotting Fissure` (45) are
                     the ONLY evidence behind his bare `Black Cleft` / `Rotting Fissure` rows.
                     Treating them as one entity would have declared two rows witnessed by
                     footage of a different physical charm.

  FOLDING TOO LITTLE `Atma's Scarab` sat unwitnessed while 54 sightings were banked under
                     `Atma’s Scarab` — the same name, a different apostrophe byte. Same for
                     `Saracen's Chance` (55) and `Athena's Wrath (set piece)` (50).

So the axis is not "how similar are these strings". It is: does the difference name a DIFFERENT
OBJECT (identity — keep) or a different PRINTING of the same object (rendering — fold)?

⚠ THE CASE THAT PROVES THE RULE HAS TO BE MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. `Athena's Wrath (set piece)`
and `Crescent Moon (amulet)` carry the same punctuation and mean opposite things:
`Athena's Wrath` is a unique and nothing else, so the suffix is the board being readable;
`Crescent Moon` is a unique AND a runeword, so the suffix is the only thing telling two real
items apart. Folding it would let a runeword sighting witness a unique amulet. One rule
separates them and it is a measurement against the rosters, not a guess about punctuation.
