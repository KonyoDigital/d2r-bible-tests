"""A HOST DEPENDENCY IS NOT ALWAYS A PYTHON ATTRIBUTE, AND ci_sim COULD ONLY EXPRESS THAT ONE.

`tv/ci_sim.py` answers one question — *would this pass on a runner?* — and `HOST_STUBS` is the
durable record of what his Mac silently provides. MEASURED before this file was written: all three
entries patch a python MODULE ATTRIBUTE (`control_app.board_identity_drift`,
`control_app._tree_is_mid_edit`, `console_doctor.slow_surface`), and **neither CI-vs-Mac
disagreement found in the week of 2026-09-23 is one**:

  · `tv/bin/ocr_mac` is a MACOS BINARY ON DISK. "this executable cannot run here" is a filesystem
    fact — no attribute carries it.
  · "this interpreter starts children with fork_exec where Linux uses posix_spawn" is a PLATFORM
    fact about CPython and this kernel. **You cannot patch a Mac into being Linux.**

So the simulator printed "🟢 no KNOWN host dependency" about both of them — the same shape as the
third HOST_STUBS entry's own comment, which records that THE LIVE SITE DID NOT DEPLOY ALL DAY
while the code was correct throughout.

WHAT WAS MEASURED HERE, because the fix turns on it and a guess would have built the wrong stub:

  · `git ls-files` TRACKS `tv/bin/ocr_mac`, and `file` calls it "Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64".
    So on ubuntu-latest the path is PRESENT with its exec bit — `tv_diablo._ocr_worker_cmd()`'s
    `os.path.isfile(OCR_BIN) and os.access(OCR_BIN, os.X_OK)` guard PASSES there, the fast lane is
    taken, and the failure lands one step later at exec as OSError errno 8 "Exec format error".
    ⚠ Stubbing that path ABSENT would therefore simulate a world CI does not have and would hide
    the guard being taken. The mode is `not-executable`, and the two modes are different laws.
  · `test_a_broken_pipe_must_not_skip_the_reap` spawns NO ocr binary at all — audited with
    `sys.addaudithook`, its whole run is two `subprocess.Popen` of `sys.executable`, and the one
    occurrence of the string "ocr_mac" in it is in its module DOCSTRING. A text scan for that name
    would have been grepping prose. [[source-reading-guard]] §4. What it really leans on is the
    PLATFORM fact, and `test_closing_the_worker_stdin_CANNOT_BLOCK_THE_CALLER` — green here in
    5.3s, red on the runner at 25.4s against its own >20s bound — is the test that pays for it.
  · The platform detector was sized before it was written, because a row that cries wolf gets
    silenced and that costs more than the defect: **8,111 test methods across every tv/test_*.py,
    64 flagged (0.79%)**; 16 inside test_control.py.

⚠ THE PROPERTY THIS FILE PROTECTS ABOVE ALL: ci_sim states its own reach in the same breath as its
verdict. Every new capability must EXTEND that sentence, never weaken it — so the UNKNOWN verdict
still carries "only the stubs above were neutralised", and the new stub kind carries the same
refusal the attribute kind has: an inert stub exits 2 rather than silently simulating less than it
claims. [[unknown-stays-unknown]] [[regression-guard]]
