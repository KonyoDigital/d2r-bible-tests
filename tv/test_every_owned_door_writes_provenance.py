"""EVERY DOOR INTO `owned` SAYS WHO FILED IT — and the live route files what he HOLDS. Driven on the shipped
board code (cut from bible.html by its markers, run in node), never re-typed.

His words, 2026-09-28: "where is the ledger proof of these two items? i cant find it.. how can i see the evidence
and picture pixels from the session it was extracted from", "its correct btw.. just want to see it and see how its
read so we can surgically fix", "make sure the others have the same logic too", "fix the route so they flow
correctly", and his ruling the same day (HANDOFF §28): a CHRONICLE-PAGE read is found-ever, NOT the vault.

MEASURED on a copy of his store (read-only): owned = [Plague, Grief] with NO d2r_vaultProv row for either — the
trail lived only in d2r_chronicleInboxLog (aic-judge, one session, two frames). The door that owned them
(aicJudgeApply's keep tier) wrote no provenance, and neither did its siblings (22 bare `owned.add(` sites). And the
live register wrote String of Ears — read WORN — only to the found list: kaiChroniclePropose returned from its
"already in the Chronicle" branch before the vault was ever asked.

WHAT THIS LAW HOLDS:
  · THE CENSUS — every `owned.add(` in CODE (a JS scanner: comments, strings, templates and regex literals are
    not code) sits inside the ⟦OWNED PROV⟧ door, except the two NAMED vaultFile sites, each with its reason.
  · THE DOOR — window._ownedAdd writes a kind:'owned' RECEIPT (source, when, session, frame, place, scene, look);
    it never clobbers a filing row (the §24 rebuild's tier / successes / trials stay); a standing receipt only
    fills what it lacks and adds a NEW look to its tally; no source → no row (never invented); a store that will
    not parse is never written over.
  · THE ROUTE — worn / stash / cube / mule files into the dock; a Chronicle page never does, even with a place on
    it; the floor never; an UNKNOWN place waits. ⚠ §31.2 (his ruling, 2026-09-28) SUPERSEDES v2346 / REG-426 for
    inventory LOOT: a name the reader placed in his inventory is CARRIED — owned right away, on that character's
    strip, never filed; it LANDS on a stash-tab / mule look and LEAVES only on a floor / vendor / trade look with its
    frame; absence asks "still have it?" after a few sessions and never un-owns. Standing kit stays §29.
  · THE REVIEW OF 77d8d8b5, each reproduced and driven here: H1 (one sighting, one tuple; the held one routes and is
    cited), M3 (the backfill stamp forks per world, a read replays only into its own world, his removals never come
    back), M4 (owned_restore and the un-seed Undo write receipts; every d2r_owned write is censused), L1 (no vault
    claim decided on the bare predicate), L2 (the backfill's side writes are journaled and undone).
  · THE BACKFILL — on a fixture store shaped like his: Grief and Plague gain their receipts from their own
    aic-judge rows; String of Ears (worn) is filed with a receipt; the seven Chronicle-page reads, the floor
    read, the unknown one, a dismissed one and one still waiting for his ruling are NOT; a second run is a
    no-op (idempotent); the undo takes back exactly what it did, through the removal door.
  · A RECEIPT IS NEVER A WITNESS — the sorter files nothing on it and the W6 prune keeps no filing on it.
  · THE EVIDENCE PANEL — who / when / session / frame / tally from the store; an item with no provenance says
    so in words; a picture that loads is shown, one that does not is said in words (the console's reason, or
    UNKNOWN) and never drawn as an <img>.
  · THE JOINS — the settled branch of kaiChroniclePropose asks the route before it returns, and aicJudgeApply's
    runeword keep writes its receipt through the door.
