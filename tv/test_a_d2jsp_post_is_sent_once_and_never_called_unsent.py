"""REG-2490 / REG-2491 / REG-2495 / REG-2496 - A d2jsp POST IS SENT ONCE, AND A CLICKED POST IS NEVER CALLED UNSENT.

#106 (Reviewer D), measured at v3784 (7285e7efc):
  - one 25 s deadline in _chrome_post covered loading the board, opening New Trade, filling the
    form, the submit and the redirect. A run that had clicked and had not reached topic.php came
    back as the post.php URL, which _send_through_chrome called 'not-posted', and any OSError after
    the click was 'unread'. Both read "nothing was posted" on the page, so he clicks again and a
    duplicate goes up. _chrome_edit and _send_edit (the shop list's saved topic) had the same shape.
  - the server had no lock. d2jsp_send ran once per request on a ThreadingHTTPServer, so a board
    reload or a second tab started a second Chrome post; only the page's `posting` flag guarded it.
#83: an ImportError of websocket escaped the route, and a Chrome that would not start read 'unread'.
T1 review: the re-send record answered A, B, A on one topic 'already-posted' while the board showed B
(REG-2495); a fill DevTools answered with an error in place of a result read as no click (REG-2496);
and no case here ran the click mark or the edit flow, so deleting either stayed green.

No Chrome runs here. The REAL flow (_chrome_post / _chrome_edit, _run_flow, _flow_step) drives the
REAL desk._Page - so _cdp_call, _SNAPSHOT_JS, _open_link_js and _fill_js are what run - over
DevTools(), a socket whose tab is a Board made of strings, on a clock the flow's own naps move. The
Board answers those expressions the way a page does: each document has its own window, so the mark
the fill script sets is gone on the next document, a form still loading has no button yet, and an
expression it cannot read is recorded and fails the case.
  - two sends at once (threads and an Event): one Chrome post runs; the other is busy, reads no cookie.
  - the form and the receipt have their own budgets: a board that shows the form after 20 s and the
    new topic 25 s after the click is submitted, and the fill never runs on a form still loading.
  - the click mark: the compose page the submit has not left yet is not the form sent back.
  - a click with no receipt is maybe-sent with the board and the time, and so is a browser that stops
    answering once the fill was sent; a fill answered with an error in place of a result is a click.
    The board sending the form back is not-posted, and so is a run that never clicked; unread when no
    forum page ever loaded. The page the click was on is never its own receipt.
  - an edit of the saved topic: the topic is submitted, a click with no receipt is maybe-sent, the
    form sent back or a topic with no Edit link is not-posted, and an edit never opens a new trade.
  - after the receipt wait the board list is read again, once it has loaded: a new topic whose text is
    exactly the subject is the receipt; an older one, listed before the click or bumped in from page 2,
    never is, and two new ones are maybe-sent.
  - the same draft inside 30 minutes of maybe-sent / submitted reads no cookie and starts no Chrome
    (maybe-sent-recently / already-posted); another body, another board, or 30 minutes later, runs.
    A, B, A on one topic runs the third edit, and a record that names no topic never holds back an edit.
  - the urllib seam a law drives (production posts through Chrome) posts once: after its POST a lost
    answer or an unknown page is maybe-sent, and only the form coming back is not-posted.
  - a missing websocket module, a missing Chrome and a Chrome that exits before its DevTools answers
    are chrome-start with a why, and leave no profile and nothing in flight.
  - every answer's reason is one of SEND_REASONS, and none carries the cookie.
RED_PROOF below.
