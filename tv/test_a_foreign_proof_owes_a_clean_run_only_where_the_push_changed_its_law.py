"""REG-2599 (#242 narrowed) - A PROOF ANOTHER TREE BANKED OWES A CLEAN RUN HERE ONLY WHEN THE PUSH CHANGES ITS LAW.

#242 / REG-2587 made every gate served from another tree (a CI census shard, the box) run one untampered run in THIS
tree before its PROVENs were kept. Elad, 2026-10-23: proofs banked elsewhere must become HITS in the Mac pre-push hook,
and a clean run per served gate is most of what a hit saves. Keep the guard where it guards something: a gate whose OWN
law file this push changes still owes its clean run here; a gate in the push for any other reason is kept on the other
tree's word, over byte-identical inputs. What the push changes being UNKNOWN keeps the old guard for every gate.

  1. _direct_laws: the gates whose own law file is in the push's changed set; None when that set is unknown;
  2. the main pass: law not changed -> no clean run, PROVENs kept, said once; law changed / unknown -> one clean run;
  3. the clean wave: a gate served whole from another tree is skipped when its law is not changed, asked when it is;
  4. _prove_push reads what the push changes and says how many gates still owe a clean run; a failed read owes all.
Drives the REAL _prove_gate / _wave_gate / _prove_push paths over a temp gate and a temp cache.
