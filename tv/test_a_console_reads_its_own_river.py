"""#193 — A CONSOLE READS ITS OWN RIVER, AND A PC THAT JUST STARTED SAYS SO.

His words, 2026-10-27: *"river says unknown now. make sure its all working and UX and UI freindly"*.

Measured that evening on the Fleet (/api/fleet): the ALT row had lanes but a null heart census, so it said a bare
"river UNKNOWN". Asked the ALT console directly a few minutes later, it said census stale, key aside-cooldown. The
null came from the beacon a self-update sent BEFORE the self-prove lane's first tick, which lands about 5 minutes
after a start. And a console nobody had opened the River on sent "this console has not computed its river since it
started", because only /api/river fills _RIVER_LAST and the beacon never computes it.

Three joints, each driven:
  · the console: the tvd-river-warm lane asks its OWN read-only /api/river a minute after a start and whenever the
    last read is over RIVER_WARM_STALE_S old, never while he plays or the machine is busy; it is on the roster, stood
    down under a harness, and leaves a trace. The beacon names the boot window: key 'starting', census still null.
  · the worker (functions/api/console.js, the REAL shaper in node): key 'starting' crosses; census stays null.
  · the card (control_ui.html, the REAL _fleetStuckChip / _fleetSysParts in node): 'river · starting' in muted
    words and 'first check pending', still UNKNOWN; a null census WITHOUT that key is still 'river UNKNOWN'.
RED_PROOF below.
