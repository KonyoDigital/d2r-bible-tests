"""#171 (REG-2482) - STRAY PROCESSES ARE MEASURED ON WINDOWS, BY THE KERNEL'S OWN COUNTERS.

MEASURED on Dean's PC 2026-10-22: 'stray processes' UNKNOWN for 45 days - "`ps` could not be asked for a CPU sample".
There is no ps on Windows, so the runaway watch (the 28-hour core-burner class) was blind on every Windows PC. The
Windows sweep asks the same question the same way: two CUMULATIVE CPU-time samples, the second from the previous call,
busy only on what a process burned BETWEEN them, and old by the creation time child_guard's birth reader reads.

Driven with fixture samples on any PC:
  * busy and old -> a suspect (and young, idle, reused-pid and born-after-the-first-sample processes are not);
  * his game and Windows' own images are excused - but never a Windows host running THIS tree's code;
  * one sample -> UNMEASURED, never a verdict;
  * an unreadable sampler -> UNMEASURED, never "nothing busy" - and the last good sample is kept;
  * an idle machine -> OK, and the sentence names what was scanned and by what;
  * WHOSE a suspect is comes from the REAL attribution as it runs on Windows - no lsof, no ps, nothing stubbed: his
    ports cannot be read there, so it fails CLOSED (never "mine"), spawns nothing, never reads the spawn ledger, and
    the row says exactly that. The first cut stubbed the port witness to "no port of his" and asserted a WARN 'OF
    OURS' that a real Windows PC can never produce, while the row it banked claimed three checks that never ran.
