"""REG-2004 - A JOIN THAT IS DONE, OR WHOSE ONE RE-READ IS SPENT, MOVES ON. #168, his 10-02 keep-16 ruling.

MEASURED on his Mac 2026-10-07 18:5x (read-only): the drain sat BLOCKED behind JOIN 9 (oldest 8.2 days), and the stuck
note printed reel_router.OWES's standing text - "the seal does not carry them. Code. No lane can fix that; an edit can"
- while #152 slice 4's join re-read lane had 3 queued and 16 tried. extract_gap ruled all 13 on-shelf JOIN reels
RECOVERABLE, and they split two ways:
  * 6 had seals frame_authority CERTIFIED (sealVerdict COVERED: name, location, provenance taken) - the RECOVERABLE
    branch never asked `_cert`, so a FINISHED join read as owed for ever;
  * 7 had their ONE re-read (0.5-21 h earlier) and the seal still recorded an empty examination - nothing could ever
    move them. His ruling: everything but the newest 16 (and the fixtures) is extracted, tallied and tombstoned FIFO,
    "no station may hold a reel for ever", JOIN included.
Applied by hand to his shelf the new rule moves all 13 (6 joined + 7 spent past the shield); none is left waiting.

WHAT THIS LAW DRIVES (real code each time):
  * extract_gap.gap(): a sealed, named, CERTIFIED reel is JOINED; the same reel uncertified is still RECOVERABLE;
  * reel_router._owes_of: JOINED owes nothing (the engine's word forwarded); RECOVERABLE still owes the join;
  * reel_route_lane.plan(): JOINED routes; a RECOVERABLE whose re-read is spent AND that sits past the newest-16
    shield routes; the same reel inside the shield, unspent, a fixture, or with spent/pinned unreadable WAITS;
  * control_app: _join_reread_spent is tried-minus-queued, _route_pinned_reels fails closed while the scan runs, the
    triage tick hands both to the lane, and the JOIN stuck note says the join lane's own state.
