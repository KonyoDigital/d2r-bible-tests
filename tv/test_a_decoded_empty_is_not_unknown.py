"""v3177 — A MASK THAT DECODED TO NOTHING IS A ZERO, NOT AN UNKNOWN.

FOUND BY THE CODEX EYE reviewing v3175 (cross-family, openai/gpt-5.6-terra):

    "Medium — a valid empty local item list is rendered as unknown/unpublished. In
     fleet_compare, `if _mine_names` treats an empty successfully decoded list ..."

It is right, and it is the scar the surrounding comment already cites. fleet_mask.decode()
returns (None, why) when the answer would be a GUESS, and ([], None) when the mask decoded
cleanly and he owns none of that ledger. An empty list is FALSY, so `if _mine_names` folded a
real measured zero into "this console published no mask".

★ WHY THAT MATTERS HERE MORE THAN ALMOST ANYWHERE. This panel exists to keep exactly one
distinction — "I have none of these" versus "I could not find out" — and the console has had to
correct that confusion repeatedly: UNIQUES SYNCED over 0/403 (v2875), the both-need column
refusing rather than claiming 0 (v3022), a dead fetch that had to say UNKNOWN rather than paint
parity. Getting it wrong in the code that DRAWS the distinction is the worst place for it.

⚠ AND HE OWNS 132 OF 135 TODAY, so this branch is not exercised by his own data. A gate blind to
what his data never exercises is the failure this file is guarding against.
