"""REG-2598 - A GATE NEVER STARTS ON A RUN RECORD THE GATE BEFORE IT WROTE.

MEASURED on the dcff7160 16-shard run: shard 16's lane ran hover-wilson, whose hover_wilson.py banks a row into
tv/.self_arming.jsonl - a run record git tracks, and a named input of every law that reaches self_arming. Every law that
lane proved after it (91 proofs in 12 laws) was keyed and proved over that row, so no checkout's bytes gave its key and
the import could serve none of them. _drop_run_records cleaned the sandbox once, when it was built; a lane proves many
gates in it. heart2 now puts the records back, as the sandbox was built, before each gate.

These cases build the same FIXTURE repo test_a_sandbox_never_carries_a_run_record builds (its helpers, never restated),
drive the real make_sandbox, write a record in the SANDBOX the way a gate run does, and read it back by name.
