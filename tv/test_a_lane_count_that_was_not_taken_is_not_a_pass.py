"""#86 gap audit 25 (REG-1783) — A LANE COUNT THAT WAS NOT TAKEN IS NOT A PASS.

The shelf row returned OK while its sentence said the per-lane count was UNKNOWN.
The eagle colours the state word, so that beat was tallied green.

  · DRIVEN: a fresh beat that says the plan was readable and carries no laneCounts.
    The state is unknown. The sentence still says so.
  · DRIVEN: a fresh beat with no ok key, and one whose ok is None. Unknown, not a pass,
    and not the stalled-lane row.
  · DRIVEN: a fresh beat that counted a reading lane is still ok. A DARK count is still
    missing. A beat forty hours old is still missing, before the count is consulted.

Nothing here reads his shelf. The stored beat is replaced for the call. RED_PROOF below.
