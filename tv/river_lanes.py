"""THE RIVER AS FOUR LANES — the shape he asked to SEE, over the nine stations that actually exist.

Konyo: *"the visual rendering of it i want it replicating a simple · INTAKE where the reels come
and get stationed · PRINTER where they get filtered · CAPTURE where they get extracted.. and
finally TOMBSTONE. now obivously the logic behind the backed is not sycned and is not 1000% doing
this.. but the stamps and everything and the movement of them going down that architure and
structure i want built. first in first out FIFO.. that way its optimzed."*

And, decisively: *"now dont get me wrong. the backend should be pinpoint perfect and nothing
fabricated what so ever.. just the visual rendering of the backend and the entire process of the
reel coming in extracted and then out i want that visually built."*

=== ⚠⚠ SO THIS IS A VIEW, NOT A SECOND PIPELINE ===
Nothing here decides where a reel is. `reel_router.route()` decides, and this GROUPS its answer.
The moment this file starts computing a station of its own, the console shows a river the backend
does not have — which is the one thing he ruled out.

=== ⚠⚠ THE LANE MAP IS A PARTITION, AND THAT IS ENFORCED ===
Every station in `reel_router.STATIONS` belongs to EXACTLY ONE lane. Not zero, not two.
`assert_partitions()` proves it against the router's own tuple rather than against a copy, so a
tenth station added upstream turns this RED instead of quietly vanishing from his screen — the
`reel_story` failure this family already lived through, where four of six stages were permanently
empty and nothing said so.

MEASURED on his shelf the day this was written (40 reels):

    INTAKE       7   INTAKE:0 + TRIAGE:0 + STATION:7 + EMPTY:0
    PRINTER     11   PRINTER:11
    CAPTURE     16   CAPTURE:12 + JOIN:4
    TOMBSTONE    6   ROUTED:6 + TOMBSTONE:0
    TOTAL       40   = shelf, reconciles True

⚠ TOMBSTONE READS 6 AND NOT 0 ONLY BECAUSE v2764 UNWELDED ROUTED FROM THE DELETER. Before that,
the last lane could never hold anything: the only writer of a tombstone row lived inside the
deleter, behind the arming lock. The lane would have been a permanently empty box with a label.

=== FIFO IS INHERITED, NEVER RE-SORTED ===
`reel_router.route()` already orders oldest-capture-first and puts reels with NO readable clock
LAST (None must not become 0, which is 1970 and would put every unmeasured reel at the head). A
second sort here would be a second copy of that rule, free to drift. [[copy-drift]]
