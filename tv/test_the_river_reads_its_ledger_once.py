"""#109 — /api/river'S LEDGER READS DO NOT GROW WITH THE REELS: ONCE FOR ITS OWN WALK, NOT TWICE PER REEL.

MEASURED 2026-09-30 on his ALT (over SSH, read-only): 266 reels on the shelf, 145 MB of RAM free, and /api/river did
not answer inside 60 s. The route asks river_stamp.current() and history() about every reel it lists, and each of
those re-read and re-parsed the WHOLE ledger - current() through history() - so a request read the ledger twice per
reel: quadratic in reels x rows, on the machine least able to afford it.

Now the route reads the ledger once for its own walk (rows()), groups it by reel once (index()), and hands that report
to history() and current(). One derivation - the same answers, including the never-stamped reel and the unreadable
store, which must stay two different sentences. Two other readers in the request (the census, and the router's lane
overlay inside river_lanes) read it once each per request - a constant, so the law pins the SCALING: the number of reads
is the same for 12 reels as for 48.

⚠ MEASURED BEFORE CLAIMING: the ALT's ledger is 141 KB / 480 rows, so this term cost it seconds, not the whole minute -
the rest of that route's time is measured separately (#109), never assumed to be this.

Driven, never re-implemented: river_stamp over a throwaway ledger, and the real /api/river branch of the console's GET
handler over that ledger and an empty temp shelf. [[paid-work-with-no-memory]] [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
