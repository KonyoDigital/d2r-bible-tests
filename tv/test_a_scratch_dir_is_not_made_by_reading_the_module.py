"""v3422 (#170) — A DIRECTORY CREATED AT IMPORT IS CREATED BY EVERY READER, FOREVER.

`EYE_CWD = tempfile.mkdtemp(...)` sat at module level, so it ran on IMPORT rather than on use.
THIRTY-ONE modules import `second_eye_run` — every gate that touches the eye, the ledger,
`corroborate`, `console_doctor`, `run_gates` — and each gate runs as its own subprocess, so ONE
full gate run left roughly thirty directories behind. **MEASURED 2026-09-23: three BARE imports,
no look asked and no eye run, minted three directories.** 115 were on his Mac from two days, 33 of
them that day.

⚠ #170 FILED THIS AS "a temp dir per LOOK". The measurement refutes its own premise: the looks
were never the cause. A handful of looks a day cannot produce 33 directories, and reading the task
title instead of measuring would have sent the fix to the wrong end of the file — a reaper for the
runner, while the import kept minting them. [[feedback-suspect-the-instrument]]

⚠ AND A REAPER WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WRONG FIX EVEN IF IT WORKED. The cheapest cleanup is not
accumulating: computing a path allocates nothing. [[process-port-discipline]] §5f says the teardown
that kills the port also removes the profile — this is that rule one step earlier, at the moment
the thing is made.
