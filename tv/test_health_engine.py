    threshold with owed 0. The fault was a divergence, and the console could not say so.

    The law pinned here is ORDERING, not a number: whatever `worst` is, its sentence is first.
    Pinning "evidence[0] mentions divergence" would go quietly wrong the day a stalled lane is
    the worst finding. [[regression-guard]] — pin the law, not the number.
