"""NAMING ONE OF HIS REELS IN A TEST HOLDS THAT FOOTAGE FOREVER — SO NEW ONES MUST BE DELIBERATE.

`frame_authority.test_referenced_reels()` scans `tv/test_*.py` for reel ids, and `reel_retention`
then keeps every one it finds under `test-fixture`: *"the TEST SUITE opens this reel by name —
deleting it does not turn a test red, it turns one into a permanent skip, which is worse."* That
rule is correct and was written after a prune deleted three reels the suite named.

The cost of it is that **a reel id in EXECUTABLE test code silently removes that footage from
the river permanently.**

⚠ COMMENTS AND DOCSTRINGS ARE SAFE, and that distinction is itself load-bearing. v2393 measured
his disk at **1.2 GB free of 228 GB** with 6.3 GB held under `test-fixture` — and every hit for
the two largest reels (4.8 GB together) was inside a comment or a docstring, including the
docstring of the very function that explains the defect. `_executable_only()` now strips both.
So prose about a reel costs nothing; a string literal costs the reel. [[feedback-comments-vs-code]]

MEASURED 2026-09-16 (REG-1027). Two new gates quoted four of his real reels as evidence:

    before:   test-fixture  8 · recent 8 · panels-never-banked 4
    after:    test-fixture 12 · recent 8 · panels-never-banked 0     <- 43 MB frozen
    fixed:    test-fixture  8 · recent 8 · panels-never-banked 4

⚠⚠ AND `frame_authority.py` ALREADY RECORDED THIS EXACT MISTAKE. v2071 wrote an illustrative reel
id into a guard, the orphan fold minted that directory an hour later, and retention began holding
**3.15 GB** for a reason that was false. Its docstring prescribes the remedy in as many words:
*"Use a stamp no recording can carry (the v2071 guards now use 1500000000000 — 2017) whenever a
test SYNTHESISES a reel name rather than pointing at footage on disk."* Both gates were written
without reading it, which is why prose was not enough and this is now executable.
[[carved-skill-unloaded-is-unapplied]]

⚠ THIS IS A RATCHET, NOT A BAN. 39 real ids are already named across 8 suites and several of those
tests genuinely open that footage — that is the rule working as intended. What must never happen
again is a reel joining that set BY ACCIDENT. Adding one is now an edit to
`tv/test_reel_refs.json` with the reason in the commit message.
