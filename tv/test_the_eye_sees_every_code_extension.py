"""v3388 - THE SECOND EYE ASKS GIT FOR EVERY CODE EXTENSION, NOT MOST OF THEM.

THE EYE FOUND THIS ONE ITSELF, reviewing v3387. Its answer named the gap before I did:

    "Also absent: any Cloudflare worker / functions code that actually performs the
     lastseen/webseen lookup, key matching, throttling, null-handling... All claims about
     matching behaviour, throttling, webAt presence, or UI output are therefore UNVERIFIED."

I did not take it at face value - the run had reported only TWO omitted files, which contradicts
the eye. MEASURED on that payload, and the eye was right:

    webSeenSlug     0        recordWebSeen   0
    _fleetSeen      0        webOnly         0
    functions/_middleware.js  - 0 occurrences, and NOT in the omitted list either

CAUSE: both git pathspecs listed `*.py`, `*.mjs`, `*.sh` (and `*.html` for the roster). `*.js`
was never there. Someone added the module extension and not the plain one. v3387's entire
subject is two Cloudflare function files and the eye saw NEITHER.

⚠⚠ WORSE THAN A DROPPED FILE, AND THIS IS THE PART WORTH KEEPING. A file excluded by the
pathspec is never a CANDIDATE, so v3341's "the payload names the files it left out" and v3354's
"the partial counter NAMES the file nobody saw" both reported 0 - truthfully, about a question
they were never asked. A false NEGATIVE in the instrument built to catch exactly this.
[[the-unjoined-end]] [[zero-needs-a-denominator]]

⚠ THE BLAST RADIUS IS SMALL AND STATED. My first pass said "60 of 60 versions had an unseen .js
change" - implausible agreement, which is the instrument-fault tell. Filtering _archive/ and
re-running: 1 of the last 60, and it is v3387. functions/*.js rarely changes. The honest claim
is the smaller one. [[feedback-suspect-the-instrument]]

⚠ _archive/ IS EXCLUDED ALONGSIDE. 67 tracked .js, the bulk archived build chunks under
_archive/phase_z_20260715/assets/. 0 of the last 60 versions touch that tree, so the exclusion
is a measured no-op today and a guard against one archived rebuild flooding the payload and
starving the real files - the failure v3370 fixed for the allocator.

HOW THIS FILE TESTS IT, and why not by reading the source: it CAPTURES the argv the shipped code
hands to git, then REPLAYS that exact argv against a purpose-built temp repo. So the law
exercises the pathspec that actually ships rather than a retyped copy of it, and it asks GIT
what the pathspec means rather than asking me. [[source-reading-guard]] section 1
