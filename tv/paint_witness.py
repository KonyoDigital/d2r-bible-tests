"""DID THE WINDOW ACTUALLY PAINT? — a second witness for the rescue, taken from PIXELS.

His words, 2026-09-04, after the console went black on him: *"maybe we can have like a safegaurd
for this connected to the watchdog/heart of the console that sees it rendering or something
regressing it automatically just restarts the console before i even notice it :)"*, and then:
*"and a picture harness pixel harness of some sort like a visual screenshot or something im sure
we can safegaurd it by that too if you cant archicture a bypass :)"*.

⚠⚠ THE EXISTING WITNESS ASKS THE PAGE, AND A BLANK PAGE CAN STILL ANSWER. `_UI_BEAT` is published
BY the document — `blankStrikes`, `elsHigh`, `rafNow` all come from JavaScript running inside the
window whose health is in question. That is not worthless (a wedged renderer stops beating), but
it cannot see the case he actually hit: a document that keeps beating while nothing reaches the
screen. This module never asks the page. It reads the compositor's own bitmap of his window.

⚠⚠ IT IS A WITNESS, NOT A TRIGGER, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Nothing here reloads, restarts, clicks
or writes. It answers one question — BLANK / PAINTED / UNKNOWN — and the rescue decides. Its most
valuable answer is the one that REFUSES: a window that is provably painted is a window that must
not be reloaded under him, whatever the beat says. [[heart-first]]

── WHY "MOSTLY DARK" WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG, MEASURED ON HIS RUNNING CONSOLE ───────────────────
The obvious test is "is it black?". Measured on his live window (pid 11243, 1120x660) while it was
perfectly healthy: **72.7% of sampled pixels sit below luminance 24.** His console is a dark theme.
A darkness test would have called a healthy console blank every single time it ran.

What separates them is UNIFORMITY, not darkness — how much of the window is one single colour:

    surface                              modal share      distinct luminances
    his console, BLANK (caught live)        0.9963                 8-9
    his console, healthy                0.069 / 0.122           156 / 34
    Terminal                                0.6628                 117
    Safari                                  0.4892                 125
    a synthetic all-black buffer            1.0000                   1

⚠⚠ AND THE FIRST ROW IS WHY `distinct` IS NOT PART OF THE VERDICT. This module shipped with a
second bar, `distinct <= 4`, and then found his console **blank white with only the titlebar
drawn** — and called it PAINTED, because the CHROME contributes 8-9 luminances on its own. Every
fixture behind that bar was chrome-free and no real window ever is. **The one case it existed to
catch is the case it would have missed.** Modal share alone has a margin of 0.9963 against 0.6628
for the busiest ordinary window measured. [[visual-regression-detector]]

⚠ AND THE READING IS NOISY. His healthy console measured 156 distinct luminances one moment and 34
seconds later — the content moves. The margin to the bar is enormous (0.122 vs 0.98), but a single
frame is still a sample, so `blank_strikes()` requires CONSECUTIVE agreeing frames before anyone
should act. [[regression-guard]]
