/* v1938 — THE 116/135 HE ASKED TO SEE FIXED, PINNED ON A REAL BOARD.
 *
 * Konyo, twice: "and sets.. are you sure its 118/135 how is it 87%? ingame im 85%" and then "fix the
 * 118/135 to 116/135 i want to see it fixed!". v1925 shipped the fix — the game's own Chronicle
 * *Remaining* filter, read off his reel, as a negative ledger — and NOTHING pinned the outcome in a
 * browser. tv/test_sets_base_index.py greps the source for the repair's existence; no spec had ever
 * asserted the number it produces. A fix with no guard is a fix that survives until the next edit.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PINS, and each line is a defect that actually happened:
 *   1. the arithmetic closes — 135 roster - 19 the game says he lacks = 116, never 118;
 *   2. the repair removes EXACTLY the names the game named, and invents none;
 *   3. the removals land in d2r_setRepairRemoved (MACHINE truth) and NOT in d2r_grailUnfound
 *      (HIS un-tick). v1925 wrote them into the user store, and eight assertions across four
 *      suites — v1693's nine-conflict resolver among them — read `grailUnfound` and got 2 where
 *      they required 0. Two different claims sharing one store is the whole bug;
 *   4. it is idempotent — a second load does not let the seed floor put them back, which is the
 *      only reason the suppression store has to exist at all.
