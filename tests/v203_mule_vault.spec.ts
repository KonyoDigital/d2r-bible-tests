       This asserted that every owned item except the aggregate becomes a DOCK CHIP. That held while
       nothing arrived pre-filed. v1980 ("the sweep now mules what it registers") made the boot seed
       file what it registers, so 12 names are already assigned to lockers before any fixture runs —
       and this fixture cannot undo that the way it undoes `owned`: `owned` is reachable by eval,

       `eval('assign')` throws ReferenceError and removing d2r_muleAssign only clears the store the
       already-loaded object was built from.

       MEASURED on a real page: 6 dock chips, and Vampire Gaze — one of the seeded twelve — sitting
       in a .vm-cell in UNI-ARMOR, exactly where tvVaultRegister put it (mode 'already', mule
       'uni-armor'). Nothing was lost. The product is right and the premise expired.

       So assert the fear instead of the arrangement: an item he physically owns must be somewhere
       the vault can SHOW him — the dock if unfiled, its locker if filed — and never nowhere. That
