// v1737 — TWO THINGS KONYO PAID FOR.
//
// ── 1. THE LADDER TOGGLE TURNED THINGS OFF, NOT ON ────────────────────────────────────────────
// Konyo: "its showing ladder runewords when it shouldnt be when im in non ladder. only when i
// toggle it on it should show those 9 runewords." And: "in forge tab onestep and make now.. it
// should also be resembling this logic."
//
// `_forgeIncludeLadder()` defaulted to TRUE. An unset preference meant INCLUDE, so a user who had
// never touched the toggle got the ladder-only words in the Forge lanes on a non-ladder character.
// The control only did anything once it had been switched OFF — the opposite of a toggle that
// turns a thing on. Every other surface had always hidden them off-ladder (the v577 rule: "Konyo
// plays NON-ladder, it should not be giving me these"), so the Forge was the odd one out.
//
// Measured through forgeScan() with an empty chronicle and a stocked stash: before, all eight
// ladder-only words sat in MAKE NOW with the toggle unset; after, they sit in the read-only
// `ladder` strip and appear in MAKE NOW only once the toggle is explicitly on.
//
// ⚠ RESOLVED IN v1738 — THE SET IS EIGHT. It was pinned at 8 here while three comments and Konyo
// both said "9"; he asked for it to be looked up, and it was. The Season 15 ladder-only list names
// exactly these eight (Bulwark, Cure, Ground, Hearth, Temper, Metamorphosis on helms, Mania on
// weapons, Hysteria on body armor). Mosaic WAS ladder-only and moved to non-ladder in patch 3.1,
// so leaving it unmarked is correct. RotW's five new runewords — Void, Ritual, Coven, Authority,
// Vigilance — are all present in RUNEWORD_TIP and none is ladder-restricted. And HUSTLE, the one
// real runeword absent from all 99 and therefore the best candidate for a ninth, is absent
// CORRECTLY: RotW renamed it to Mania on weapons and Hysteria on body armor, which is exactly why
// those two share one rune set (Shael+Ko+Eld) and why his own rwVerify seed recorded both failing
// off-ladder. The "9" existed only in this file's prose, never in its data.
//
// ── 2. A BASE THE FORGE NAMED, THAT ATE HIS RUNES ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Konyo: "voice of reason runeword i created a runword for it in it and it didnt work... i wasted
// runewords", and the base was a 4os Broad Sword, socketed in order, no transform.
//
// Reproduced exactly: with a 4os Broad Sword owned and Lem/Ko/El/Eld in the stash, forgeScan()
// returned MAKE NOW · Voice of Reason · Broad Sword (4os).
//
// By every source this file HAS, that pairing is legal — Broad Sword is a sword, maxSockets 4, and
// the word reads "4 socket Swords Maces". That clause is diablo2.io v3.2 data: VANILLA. He plays
// Reign of the Warlock, where the AB wiki is the authority and a correct vanilla fact can be wrong.
// The repo cannot rule on the pairing; his game can, and did. Recorded per RUNEWORD+BASE, because
// Voice of Reason is not broken — that home for it is.
//
// ── WHAT WAS FOUND AND NOT FIXED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// 2,763 of 7,692 base×runeword pairs (36%, across 281 of 508 bases) have the runeword needing MORE
// sockets than the base can ever hold — `_baseRunewords('Broad Sword')` offers Breath of the Dying
// (6) and Call to Arms (5) against a cap of 4. None of them reached a Forge lane in testing:
// forgeScan's per-branch guards catch them, and its v553 note explains why the cap is deliberately
// NOT applied at the cross (an owned base that ALREADY has N sockets proves it can hold them, even
// where our max estimate is low — a 2os Wand is real though Wand reports max 1). So this is a
// latent risk rather than a live bug, and it is pinned below rather than "fixed" by a filter that
// would suppress real bases. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
