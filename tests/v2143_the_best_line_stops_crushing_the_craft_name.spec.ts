// v2143 — #165. THE BEST-TO-MAKE LINE WAS CRUSHING THE CRAFT NAME TO ZERO WIDTH ON HIS SCREEN.
//
// v2136 put a "BEST" recommendation panel inside each craft accordion header and gave it
// `grid-column:1/-1`, with a comment promising it "spans the full row BELOW the header's flex line
// so a long recommendation can never squeeze the name or the make-now badge". The parent
// `.f-craftacc-h` is `display:flex`, and grid-column is INERT on a flex child — so the panel stayed
// on the header's line and its max-content basis ate `.f-craftacc-t` (flex:1 1 0; min-width:0).
//
// Measured on the clean tree, `.f-craftacc-name` width with the panel present vs removed:
//     1440   338 / 285 / 354 / 314   vs 1189
//     1120    18 /   0 /  34 /   0   vs  869     <- control_app.py:3417 opens his board at 1120
//      901     0 /   0 /   0 /   0   vs  650
//      375     0 /   0 /   0 /   0   vs  132
// At his own window width the name box was ZERO WIDE, so the text spilled out of it and painted
// under the make-now badge — the exact collision the comment said could never happen.
//
// ⚠ WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS ASSERTION. The natural spec here is "the name box must not overlap the
// BEST panel", and it is GREEN ON THE BROKEN TREE at every width — a zero-width box cannot
// geometrically intersect anything while its text spills past it. That spec would have sealed the
// defect in as verified. So this asserts the NAME'S WIDTH and the BEST line's TOP EDGE instead:
// both go red before the fix and green after. [[gate-blind-to-unexercised-input]]
