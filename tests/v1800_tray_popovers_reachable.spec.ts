// v1800 — A CONTROL THAT RENDERS AND CANNOT BE CLICKED.
//
// The tray popovers (.tools-legend-pop, .forge-legend-pop, .inbox-pop) are bottom-anchored at
// calc(var(--dock-h) + N) and grow UPWARD. Three separate ways that put a control out of reach,
// all measured on this file rather than reasoned about:
//
//   1. THE HEIGHT. At 1440x800 .tools-legend-pop budgeted 74vh against a viewport that could not
//      hold it and rendered at top:-42px — its heading off the top of the screen, unreachable,
//      because overflow:auto scrolls content inside a box whose own top is already gone. Fixing
//      .inbox-pop alone (v1799) left this sibling and .forge-legend-pop running.
//
//   2. THE ANCHOR. Below ~620px tall the anchor ITSELF is the defect: a box pinned at dock+118
//      cannot fit above itself on a 400px viewport at any height. There the popovers flip to
//      top-anchored, which is the only arrangement that keeps the heading on screen.
//
//   3. THE STACK. #claim-bar is position:sticky, z-index:9997; the popovers are z-index:9001. So
//      with the bar up, document.elementFromPoint over the popover's OWN ✕ returned #claim-bar:
//      the close button was rendered, styled, pointer-events:auto — and dead. Nothing about the
//      pixels says so, which is why this is pinned by a HIT TEST and not by a screenshot or a
//      geometry assertion. A test that only measured rectangles would have passed all three.
//
// The claim bar's height is measured live into --claim-h (it wraps to 96/128/147/167px as the
// viewport narrows) for the same reason --chrome-top stopped being a hardcoded 70px in v708.1: a
// guessed constant is wrong the moment the thing it stands for reflows.

         Three fixtures failed before this one, and the reason was never the one I guessed:

           attempt 1  seed + reload, poll 400ms   -> rawRows 0   "the paint is late"      WRONG
           attempt 2  seed via addInitScript      -> rawRows 0   "the write is lost"      WRONG
           attempt 3  + clear grail/retire caches -> rawRows 0   "a sibling ticked them"  WRONG

         Reproduced locally at last by spoofing navigator.webdriver, which is what makes
         _D2R_OWNER true under Playwright: the seed IS present at document start (4 rows) and the
         app empties it between 0.6s and 2s. Not lost — CONSUMED, and correctly. The receipt says
         so in its own words: "Toothrow :: already in your grail", "Battlecage :: a misread of
         Rattlecage — already in your grail". Under the owner path the board reads the BARE keys,
         where a full grail lives, so every seeded name resolves and the queue empties by design.
         That is the feature working ("i dont want it pending my decisions at all if its not
         needed"), and no amount of pre-clearing beats it: clearing d2r_foundLog at document start
         measured 0 rows, and by end of load the app had rebuilt it to 353.

         kaiChronicleUndoRetire is the door built for exactly this — a row he PUT BACK. It writes
         the keep-list, and the resolver honours that against the grail by design (v1790). So the
         fixture stops fighting the engine and asks it for the state it already models. Verified
         under the spoofed owner path: rawRows 3, pending 3, display flex, `.inbox-fab.has`
         matching. A fixture that has to disable the feature to observe it is testing something
         else. */

         reported nothing except "page.click timed out".
         The FAB is display:none until the engine returns at least one HELD row, so "not visible"
         and "not clickable" are different diagnoses and only one of them is about layout. Measured
         locally the seed holds 3 of 4 rows and the FAB is visible; that could not be reproduced on
