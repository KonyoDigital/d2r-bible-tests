// REG-2243 (#11) — THE SET-DUPE MIGRATION MUST CONFIRM THE COPY-COUNT FOLD REACHED DISK BEFORE STAMPING.
//
// window._vaultDedupeOldSetRows (REG-2229) removes the stray Unsorted copy of a set piece already filed in
// its mule, then folds that stray's copy count onto the surviving filed twin (Math.max, never undercount).
// The v3742 fix (REG-2240) already made the STAMP wait for a CONFIRMED owned-persist. But the copy-count
// FOLD still ran inside an empty catch and the stamp d2r_setDupeMigrate_v2227 was written on the next line
// REGARDLESS: if the d2r_copies write threw (quota / private mode) while the d2r_owned write succeeded, the
// stray count was dropped in memory but never reached disk, the survivor never received the Math.max, and
// the stamp blocked every retry.
//
// Subtlety this guard pins: by the time the fold runs, the stray REMOVAL is already confirmed on disk
// (vaultRemove's persistOwned + the owned-confirm above it). So simply leaving the migration UNstamped is
// not enough to drive a retry — the loose strays the migration keys off are gone, so a reload would find
// nothing to re-fold and just stamp an empty run. The fix therefore ALSO restores the removed strays to
// owned on the throw, so a healthy reload re-runs the WHOLE migration (remove + fold).
//
// This test drives that exact failure by making ONLY the d2r_copies write throw during the migration.
//   RED (pre-fix): the stamp is written anyway, the strays are left removed, and the survivor's count is
//                  stranded; a healthy reload sees "already run" and never completes the fold.
//   GREEN (fixed): no confirmed fold => no stamp; the strays are restored to owned; a healthy reload
//                  re-runs the migration and the stray's count folds onto the surviving filed twin.
