// v2200 → RETIRED IN v2203, AND THIS SPEC NOW GUARDS THE RETIREMENT.
//
// What v2200 did: it filled the vault from `d2r_foundLog` — "everything ever FOUND" — and wrote it
// into `d2r_owned`, which means "physically in your stash". Finding an item once does not mean you
// still hold it. On his board that took the vault 5 → 405 while the actual stash evidence
// (tv/vault_seen.json) was SEVENTEEN rows.
//
// v2203 retired it. The block stamps its flag with the reason and returns; everything below the
// return is `eslint-disable no-unreachable` dead code, INCLUDING the line that used to publish
// `window._vaultBackfill_v2200`. It is left in place rather than deleted so the v2203 undo can
// still recognise a machine where it ran.
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS SPEC WAS RED FOR MONTHS, AND WHAT THAT COST. Its three tests all waited up to 60s for
// `window._vaultBackfill_v2200` — a report that is now deliberately never produced. Three timeouts
// per run inside `Routine I`, a suite that has been red long enough to stop being read. A spec
// asserting a design that has since changed does not just fail; it hides the failures around it.
// [[regression-guard]] [[label-outlived-referent]]
//
// ⚠ AND THE PROTECTION IS KEPT, NOT DELETED. Deleting the file would leave nothing standing
// between his vault and a re-enable of the wrong-source fill. So the assertions moved from the
// MECHANISM (did the migration run, how fast, how many rows) to the LAW: the physical vault is
// never populated from the found-ever ledger, and his own placements are never overwritten.
