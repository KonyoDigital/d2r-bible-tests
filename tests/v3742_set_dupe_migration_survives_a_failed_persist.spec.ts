// REG-2240 (#11) — THE SET-DUPE MIGRATION MUST NOT STAMP ITSELF DONE BEFORE THE REMOVAL REACHES DISK.
//
// window._vaultDedupeOldSetRows (REG-2229) removes the stray Unsorted copy of a set piece already filed
// in its mule. Before this fix it wrote the once-per-world stamp d2r_setDupeMigrate_v2227 AND folded the
// stray's copy count onto its twin BEFORE calling vaultRemove — and vaultRemove's persistOwned() wraps
// each setItem in its own try/catch, so a quota/private-mode throw on the d2r_owned write is SWALLOWED
// and vaultRemove still returns removed:[...]. So a failed owned write left the stamp set: the next
// reload saw "already run", skipped the migration, and the stray dock copy was stranded for good — with
// its copy count already moved onto the twin (a half-state).
//
// This test drives that exact failure by making ONLY the d2r_owned write throw during the migration.
//   RED (pre-fix): the stamp is written anyway (and the count folded), so a healthy reload never retries
//                  and the stray stays stranded.
//   GREEN (fixed): no confirmed remove => no stamp and no fold; a healthy reload migrates and the stray
//                  leaves, its count folded onto the surviving filed copy, his testimony untouched.
