// REG-2229 (#11) — OLD SET-PIECE DOUBLE-ROWS: owned in BOTH the Unsorted dock AND the set mule.
//
// Before v3716 the hand/planner door owned the SHOWN set-piece name ("Tal Rasha's Horadric Crest")
// while the vault filed that same piece under its slot key ("Tal Rasha's Horadric Crest (helm)"), so
// `owned` carried BOTH forms — one filed in the set mule (assign === 'sets-major'), one left loose in
// the Unsorted dock (assign == null). bible.html:45127 names the bug: "Routing the shown name beside
// that key owned both, one filed and one left in Unsorted." v3716 resolves the name before owning +
// filing, so no NEW add double-files — but the rows written before it were never migrated, and his
// helms (Tal Rasha, Immortal King, Natalya, +1) still showed in both places.
//
// THE MIGRATION (window._vaultDedupeOldSetRows, once per world, run from renderVaultDraw): a LOOSE
// owned set piece whose SAME canonical piece (findSetPiece().piece) is already filed in a real mule is
// the stray shown-name copy — removed through the vaultRemove door (dated, journalled, undoable). His
// testimony is kept: the FILED copy and its filing stay, the Sets chronicle (d2r_setPieces) is untouched.
//
// RED without the fix: nothing removes the stray, so the bare name is still owned AND in the dock.
// GREEN with the fix: the stray bare copies are gone from owned and the dock, the filed slot copies and
// their set-mule assignments remain, and a genuinely loose set piece with no filed twin is left alone.
