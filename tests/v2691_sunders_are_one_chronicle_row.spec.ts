/* v2691 — HIS SUNDER RULING, AND THE HALF THAT BROKE LAST TIME.
 *
 * Konyo, with a screenshot of "Latent Bone Break" as its own chronicle row: "this is not a
 * duplicate.. yes we have latent of bone break but the chronicle itself is not latent thats just
 * the upgraded version of it after we upgrade in hordaic cube.. so for the chronicle all sunders
 * 6 of them need to be counted in the chronicle specifically as 1 tally for each.. and for the
 * vault that a different story the entire item database should be there regardless."
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THIS SPEC EXISTS BECAUSE THE FIRST ATTEMPT WAS REVERTED. v2680 filtered `_roster()`, which is
 * ALSO what makes an item findable and openable, so it removed the Latent charms from the HUNT as
 * well as the tally — breaking his earlier v1720 ruling ("add the 11 rotw items to the roster")
 * and silently subtracting from his found count. Eight failures, all mine, reverted in v2685.
 * So this asserts BOTH directions: the chronicle lists one row per sunder, AND nothing his ledger
 * holds stopped counting. A green on the first alone is the exact regression that shipped before.
