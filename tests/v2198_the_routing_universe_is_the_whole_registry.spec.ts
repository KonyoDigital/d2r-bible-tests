// v2198 — THE VAULT ROUTER WAS READING THE CALCULATOR'S CURATED LIST, NOT THE ITEM UNIVERSE.
//
// bible.html builds two things off the boss drop tables: ITEM_REGISTRY (every name) and ITEMS
// (the CALCULATOR's curated subset). Thirty lines above the loop that fills them, the file already
// states the rule — "Every routing consumer reads window.ITEM_REGISTRY" — and then tvVaultRegister
// and suggestMule read ITEMS.
//
// MEASURED on the shipped tree: registry 547, ITEMS 320, so 227 REAL GAME ITEMS were invisible to
// the vault router (Rixot's Keen, Biggin's Bonnet, Arctic Furs, Bane's Authority, The Dragon
// Chang). A name the router cannot find is declared unknown, gets an EXTRA_ITEMS placeholder
// written with rarity:'basic', and THEN the mule planner is asked about the placeholder. That is
// v2018's defect exactly — "ask the planner about the ITEM, not about a stub I wrote three lines
// ago" — one layer up: v2018 fixed the ORDER and left the TABLE too small.
//
// ⚠ THE HALF THAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE FIX. Konyo's ruling: "except runewords and sets and
// uniques those chronicle grails are locked already and good the way they are". A widening that
// moved a Chronicle count would be a regression no matter how correct the routing became, so the
// second test pins every count on the page against the pre-v2198 measurement.

     This asserted the page reads exactly ['0/403'] — a snapshot of a board with an EMPTY ledger,
     taken on the day. CI reads 99/99, 248/403, 108/135, 108/135, 248 / 403, which is a board whose
     seed floor has run: v659 asserts that floor MUST run and seed 245 names, so the very state
     this expectation forbids is the one another spec requires.

     A hardcoded numerator also fails every time he finds an item, which makes this test a tax on
     playing the game rather than a guard on the databases its own title names. So: assert the
     TOTALS — the universes v2198's widening must never touch — and let the counts move.
