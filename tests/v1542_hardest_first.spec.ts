// Konyo: "for the Uniqes and Sets chronicles it should be prioritized by HELL then Nightmare then
// Normal in the hunts its wanting me to do. its first run for me in Forge is Nightmare Pindleskin i
// rather finish off Hell and then the others."
//
// Both forges RANKED runs on `kph/chance` alone — drops per hour. That number does not know what
// difficulty it describes, and it prefers the easiest one twice over: Normal/NM have smaller chance
// denominators AND a kph bonus (×1.2 / ×1.1 where sources are built). So the hunt list handed him
// content he had already outgrown.
//
// v1549 CORRECTS WHERE THE PRIORITY LIVES. v1542 first made difficulty the primary key of SOURCE
// SELECTION, and that was an over-application: every item's Hell source wins, Hell sources are
// dominated by a handful of bosses, and the hunt COLLAPSED — uniques 20 runs -> 9, all seven
// resolvable set hunts onto one card. It also silently redrew the sealed grounds, which are grouped
// by the chosen source, and took three older specs red for a real reason.
//
// He asked for it "in the hunts": an ORDER. So selection is drops-per-hour again — the honest answer
// to where an item actually falls — and difficulty leads the SORT.
