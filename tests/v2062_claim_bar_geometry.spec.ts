/* THE ORIGIN IS THE FIXTURE, and getting it wrong made the first cut of this spec fail on its own
 * anti-vacuity assertion the first time CI ever ran it — which is the guard working, not failing.
 *
 * bible.html resolves _D2R_OWNER = true for `navigator.webdriver && file://` (bible.html:3715, an
 * AUTOMATION-ONLY escape hatch so the 105 file:// specs address BARE keys). An owner has no claim
 * bar. And seeding another install's d2r_ownerClaim to force a GUEST does not help either: the
 * banner's own guard is `if (claimed || window._D2R_OWNER) return` (bible.html:4127) — a guest on a
 * machine claimed by someone else is a deliberately QUIET state.
 *
 * So on file:// the bar can never appear, and a spec measuring it there measures nothing. Over an
 * http origin with NO claim in the store it appears exactly as it does for a new person.
 * MEASURED on a scratch http server before this spec was rewritten:
 *   http + no claim        owner=false  bar SHOWN 88px  --claim-h 96px
 *   http + activeProfile   owner=false  bar SHOWN       ladder ribbon present
 *   d2r_ownerClaim='*'     owner=true   bar HIDDEN      --claim-h 0px   (documented escape hatch)

/* v2062 — NOTHING MAY SIT ON THE CLAIM BAR.
 *
 * v2057 offset two fixed elements for the claim bar by inventing `--claim-bar-h` beside the
 * `--claim-h` v1800 already set. The third eye caught the duplicate; measuring the fix then found
 * that the ACCOUNT RIBBONS had never been offset at all, and were not merely overlapped but PAINTED
 * OVER — position:fixed;top:0;z-index:2000 under a sticky claim bar at z-index:9997. The one cue
 * telling him which economy he is writing to was invisible in exactly the state a fresh browser
 * starts in.
 *
 * All of that was measured BY HAND in headless Chrome. Nothing pinned it, so the next rule added
 * near the top of the page could sit on the claim bar again and every text assertion would still
 * pass — the same shape as the H1 that was 121px occluded at one width and clean at another while
 * `textContent` was identical at both. Geometry needs a geometry assertion; nobody had written one.
 *
 * THE GUEST IS THE POINT. An automated browser on file:// resolves as OWNER (v1499), and an owner
 * has no claim bar — so a spec that just loads the page measures the state where the bug cannot
 * appear. Seeding a claim belonging to a DIFFERENT install produces a guest, which is the state a
 * fresh browser is actually in.
