// few hours they landed in ITEMS too, which tripled the Calculator grid to 538 and put 66 of the
// 69 _UNI_EXTRA uniques inside the one surface bible.html says in words they must never enter.

// calculator DB — so this tripwire keeps doing its job and the number it guards did not move.

// number from CALC_ITEMS_TOTAL by design since v1717: the silospen RoW 3.0 pull put 216
// more real drops into the tables, and rows the calculator has no card for carry `nc:1`
// so they join the registry WITHOUT joining the curated calculator grid.
// v1720 — 538 → 549: Konyo ruled the 11 RotW uniques the pull found (Entropy Locket,
// Hellwarden's Will, the two missing Latent sunders, Measured Wrath, Opalvein, Sling, the three
// Ars charms, Gheed's Wager) into the GRAIL ROSTER, so their drop rows came back. They carry
// `nc:1` and stay out of CALC_ITEMS_TOTAL, which is why only this number moves.
// v1724 — 549 → 548 and the calculator 322 → 321: "Bloodmoon's Light" was removed. Its ITEM_CODEX
// entry gave its base item as "Reign of the Warlock" — the MOD'S NAME — with a note describing a
// sin claw and drop numbers cloning Jade Talon (tc85/qlvl71). Absent from ITEM_VALUE, the roster,
// his ledger and silospen's pool. A garbled ingest row, not an item.
// v1725 — 548 → 547 and the calculator 321 → 320: `Crescent Moon (sword)` was the RUNEWORD
// (ITEM_TIP: "t":"Runeword", Shael+Um+Tir affixes) listed as a farmable unique in ELEVEN boss
// drop tables, with a codex entry calling it a unique amulet. A runeword cannot drop.
// Same tripwire rule as its sibling: exact, and bumped deliberately.
