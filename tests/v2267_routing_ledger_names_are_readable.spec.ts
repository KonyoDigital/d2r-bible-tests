/* v2267 — THE ITEM NAME WAS THE ONLY THING IN THE ROW ALLOWED TO SHRINK.
 *
 * Measured on the vault tab in the natural state — no fixture, no seeding — ALL 40 .vrg-name cells
 * were clipped at 1440 AND 901 AND 375, with cuts of 73-97%:
 *
 *     Boneslayer Blade     106/3px    97% gone   <- three pixels of the name
 *     Bloodtree Stump      103/9px    91%
 *     Astreon's Iron Ward  122/15px   88%
 *
 * and nothing in the ancestor chain carried a title, so the full name was reachable NOWHERE.
 *
 * ONE ASYMMETRY CAUSED IT. A 233px row held: art 26 (flex 0/0) · NAME (flex 1/1, min-width:0) ·
 * "Low" 32 (flex 0/0) · "→ UNI-WEAPONS" 82 (flex 0/1 but min-width:auto, so it never shrinks below
 * its content) · ✕ 18 · four 8px gaps. The name was the only child that could give, so it absorbed
 * the whole squeeze while the DESTINATION LABEL kept all 82 pixels. The row spent its width saying
 * where the item was going and left three pixels for which item it was.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE FIRST FIX MOVED THE DEFECT RATHER THAN CURING IT. A min-width floor on the name alone
 * took name-clipping from 40 to 9 and put 40 of 40 TAGS into ellipsis — the column was simply too
 * narrow for its own contents, and every knob inside it was rearranging the same shortfall.
 * Widening the grid floor (250px → 330px, fitting the measured 204px of furniture plus a 122px
 * name) is what actually fixed it.
 *
 * HOW IT WAS FOUND, AND THE NEAR-MISS: a cross-family read of a screenshot reported "vrg-name
 * 119/60". I nearly dismissed it — my first check measured the TOOLS tab, where this table does not
 * render at all, and reported 0 clipped. Suspect the instrument.
 *
 * VENUE: a browser spec. Runs on GitHub CI, never on his Mac. [[test-venue]]

  /* ⚠⚠ v2667 — THE CONTAINMENT HALF WAS DESCRIBED IN BUGS.md AND NEVER EXISTED HERE. REG-620's
     entry says "the acceptance test asserts BOTH: zero cut AND .vrg-x still inside .vrg-det" —
     but that assertion lived in a scratchpad probe, not in this spec. A guard documented and not
     built is worse than one that is missing, because the write-up reads as covered.
     ⚠ AND IT IS THE HALF A TEXT PROBE CANNOT SEE: .vrg-det carries overflow:hidden, so a name
     that refuses to shrink pushes the row's TAIL — .vrg-x, the REMOVE button — past a clipping
     edge. Zero cut with an unreachable control is a WORSE console, and `cut%` would still read 0.
     ⚠ maxLostButtons IS 0 AT EVERY WIDTH, INCLUDING 375, AND THAT WILL BE RED THERE ON ARRIVAL.
     MEASURED at 375x800: all seven .vrg-x sit outside .vrg-det (right 360 against a container
     right of 333) and the column CANNOT scroll to them (scrollWidth 328 === clientWidth 328). It
     is PRE-EXISTING — identical with the original CSS — and it is filed as REG-621. Budgeting it
     to 7 here would make the gate agree that seven unreachable buttons are fine, which is not a
     verdict anyone earned. A red that names a real defect is the point of the gate. */
