/* v2373 (test-only) — CAN HE ACTUALLY CLICK "Do this now"?
 *
 * A cold cross-family look at v2371 read the taskforce render and said the overlay "wholly covers
 * the lower portion of the MISSION BRIEF section and the buttons below it (including parts of
 * 'Do this now', 'Pin mission')". It named the DOCK as the cover. It is not the dock: with the
 * button scrolled into view at 1440x1000, elementFromPoint at its centre answers #inbox-sticky
 * (position:sticky, z-index:60).
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THIS LIVES HERE AND NOT IN THE PYTHON HARNESS. I could not settle it on the Mac. Under
 * CDP `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`, document.scrollingElement reports scrollHeight 2206
 * against clientHeight 1000 with html/body overflow `visible` — and setting scrollTop to 300
 * yields 0. The element never moves, so the scan reported "tested=0, NEVER clickable at any
 * scroll position" with an EMPTY coveredBy: an unfalsifiable answer wearing the clothes of a
 * verdict. That is the 27-dead-links shape — a harness that cannot reach its subject reporting
 * the subject as broken — and it is exactly what `feedback-suspect-the-instrument` is about.
 * Playwright drives a real browser that really scrolls, so this is the venue that can answer.
 *
 * THE LAW, and it is deliberately the weak one: a control the user can scroll out from under is
 * NOT unreachable, it is merely somewhere else right now. So this does not demand that the CTA be
 * clear at every scroll position — a sticky panel passing over content is the page working. It
 * demands that there EXISTS a scroll position where the button answers the hit test for itself.
 * If none exists, the button is dead wherever he goes, and that is the defect worth his time.
 *
 * The inbox is seeded so #inbox-sticky carries `.has` — without it the panel is display:none and
 * this case would pass by testing a world where the suspected cover does not exist at all.
