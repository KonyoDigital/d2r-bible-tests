/* v1939 (test-only) — ONE QUANTITY, ONE NUMBER, ON EVERY SCREEN THAT PRINTS IT.
 *
 * Konyo's screen, 2026-08-20: the DAILY PICK said "Sets · 112/135 pieces", the progress row under it
 * said 113/135, and the F·Sets tab said 116/135. Three numbers for one quantity on two screens, and
 * he had to be the one to notice. Nothing in the suite asserted that these surfaces agree — each was
 * tested against its own source, which is exactly how three of them drift apart while every test
 * stays green.
 *
 * AND THE HALF THAT MATTERS MOST IS THE SECOND ONE. v1939: the repair edited storage without syncing
 * the live in-memory Set, so the count was right on load and wrong after the first click — 116, then
 * 134. A boot-time-only check cannot see that. So this measures every surface TWICE: once as the
 * board settles, and once after a real interaction through the real toggle.
 *
 * DISCOVERY, NOT A HARDCODED LIST. The surfaces are found by scanning the rendered DOM for anything
 * shaped like "<n> / 135", so a NEW screen that prints the count is covered the day it ships. A
 * hardcoded list of three selectors would have passed forever while a fourth surface drifted.
