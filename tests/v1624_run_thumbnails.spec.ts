// v1624 — THE RUN'S PICTURE IS THE RUN.
//
// Konyo: "the item logos on the left for each Hell mephisto and the pindleskin.. like what are they
// representing? ... something might be not coded properly and its confusing fix it please too".
//
// The thumbnail was art(r.items[0].n) — whichever unique happened to sort FIRST in that run's drop
// list, with a target glyph when that item had no art. Not the boss, not the fastest drop, not the
// level: an arbitrary picture that changed as his grail changed. Pindleskin rendered a bare emoji
// for no reason a reader could infer.
//
// His call: "for best runs it shows us the boss as a main.. and for quick wins we dont touch and
// leave it as is which is the item as the main" — both clickable, both with the hover card.
//
// v1643 — WHY THIS SPEC WAS RED FROM ~v1634 AND WHAT IT NOW MEASURES (REG-129).
// v1636 (d200b7b) deliberately replaced data-art-logo with data-boss-tip on the best-run
// .f-runart span, because data-art-logo resolves through the ITEM art map and so hovering
// Mephisto's correct PORTRAIT opened his SOULSTONE card. The app was right; this spec kept
// reading the attribute that no longer exists and failed on a NULL — and a null is never a
// passing result, so the suite stayed red for nine versions with nobody reading the message.
//
// The naive fix (s/data-art-logo/data-boss-tip/) would have made the containment assertion
// compare a title against an ID ("Hell TZ Pindleskin" vs "pindle"), which happens to pass for
// four ids and is nonsense for the rest ("Hell Bovines" does not contain "cows"). What is
// asserted instead is the thing the assertion was always REACHING for: the id is resolved
// through BOSSES to that boss's NAME, and the row's title must name that boss. That is the
// check that catches the real defect underneath — a best-run row titled Pindleskin carrying
// bossId 'nihl', which opens Nihlathak's card and portrait under Pindleskin's name.
