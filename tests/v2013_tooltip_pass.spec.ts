/* v2013 — 🔎 THE TOOLTIP PASS. Konyo: "or to click on what within the console? like we need a
 * feature button for this thats on/off cool desgined".
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR, measured by vault_doctor on his own film: 220 occupied cells across 10 stash
 * panels and ZERO readable names. D2R prints no names in a grid — a name exists only in the HOVER
 * TOOLTIP — so the whole chain starves on one thing only he can do.
 *
 * WHY A BUTTON. The three states already existed and had to be set SEPARATELY: arm the vault lane,
 * wake the shadow reader, start a reel. Three controls in two places, and getting one wrong makes
 * the pass silently worthless — the exact shape this board keeps auditing out.
 *
 * The on-console behaviour was proven against a stub on :17771 (never :17772, his live console):
 *     ok      -> "🔴 rolling — HOVER each item you want named."          switch amber, badge shown
 *     refused -> "lane armed and reader on, but the reel did not start: already recording…"
 * This spec pins what a file:// run can observe, and the parts that must hold everywhere.

   items reads 0 rather than 3. That arithmetic did NOT go away — it lives in tooltipPassState()
   (`named: _tpOwnedCount() - st.baseline`), which the spec above now pins as surviving. What is

   hand session (~9GB/hour when nobody plays). Both rows now read and write the ONE shadow switch, and the shadow
   watcher opens and seals its own hidden reels. The old test drove the retired pass (d2r_tooltipPass, a yield, a
   sealed flag) and went red on v3521's CI for a contract that no longer exists. What must hold now, and what this
   drives with the console's two routes stubbed (the scar the old test guarded is the same one):
     · it flips the switch it READ: shadow on -> POST {on:false}, and says OFF;
     · it NEVER POSTs /api/on or /api/off - it cannot start a hand session and cannot stop HIS reel;
