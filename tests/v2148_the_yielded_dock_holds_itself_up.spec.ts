// v2148 — THE YIELD'S HOVER-RESTORE COULD NOT HOLD ITSELF UP AT HIS OWN WINDOW WIDTH.
//
// v2146 extended the v694 yield law to the vault room: `html.vault-open .control-dock` slides down
// by `translateY(calc(100% - 20px))`, leaving a 20px lip, and `:hover` brings it back. The lip IS
// .dock-inner's top edge, so pointing at it does fire :hover and the dock does spring back.
//
// But .control-dock carries `padding-bottom:14px` that is pointer-events:none — deliberately, so
// the side gutters stay click-through for the corner FABs. So once the dock is FULLY restored, its
// .dock-inner ends ABOVE the cursor that just summoned it. Measured at 1120 on the broken tree:
// inner bottom 886, cursor 888. Two pixels. Hover is lost, the dock falls, the lip returns under
// the cursor, hover fires again — for as long as he leaves the pointer there.
//
// translateY, sampled 16x over 4s with the mouse held PERFECTLY STILL:
//     1440   [1,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0]     <- never settles
//     1120   [7,6,0,6,6,6,0,6,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0]     <- his window. never settles
//      901   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
//      375   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
// The same 16x sample on the FIXED tree, same harness, same widths:
//     1440   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
//     1120   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
//      901   [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]   (one in-flight frame, then flat)
//      375   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
// Measured with CDP on scratch headless Chrome (:9226), driving a REAL Input.dispatchMouseEvent
// rather than a synthetic hover, because the defect lives in hit-testing.
//
// At 901/375 the dock wraps to more rows and is TALLER, so the cursor stays inside .dock-inner and
// it is a flat zero. That is why every narrow-viewport check was clean, and why this needs the
// WIDE widths — the mirror of the usual "render narrow too" rule. [[gate-blind-to-unexercised-input]]
//
// ⚠ WHY THE ASSERTION IS "DID IT MOVE" AND NOT "HOW FAR".
// The first verdict I wrote called this SETTLED, on a `max-min > 8` threshold — while the real
// signal's maximum is 7. A threshold above the ceiling is an absent one, and it turned a live
// defect into a green line. [[feedback-threshold-above-the-ceiling]] The amplitude here is small
// BY CONSTRUCTION: each bounce is caught and reversed within one frame, so a defect that never
// stops is measured in single-digit pixels. The signal is that the number CHANGES AT ALL.
