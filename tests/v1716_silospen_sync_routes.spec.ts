// v1716 — THE FARM BOARD WAS ROUTING OFF DATA THAT DID NOT COVER THE GAME.
//
// Konyo, on his own board: "for SETS i also see pindleskin as the runs... so thats definitely
// bugged.. + i see alot of UNVERIFIED boss hunts for farming which dont render anything at all."
//
// Both were true, and they were three separate defects:
//
//  1. SETS had no per-piece drop data at all — 14 "any piece" aggregate rows for 34 sets. The
//     picker maximises kph/chance and Pindleskin's kph (300-360) is 3-10x every other boss, so
//     the aggregate handed him TWO run cards, both Pindleskin, and 21 sets with no route.
//  2. The roster and the drop tables spell items differently. "Harlequin Crest" could not see
//     the row named "Harlequin Crest (Shako)", so the most farmed unique in the game rendered
//     as "no verified source yet" — 33 uniques sat in that bucket.
//  3. The tables were genuinely short: silospen RoW 3.0 lists 348 uniques for Hell Mephisto,
//     the tree carried 277.
//
// The 2026-08-16 silospen pull (D2R_ROW_3_0, MF=300, players=1, desecratedLevel 50/76/99 — the
// same convention the stored cells were pulled under: 230 of 243 overlapping Hell-Mephisto rows
// matched EXACTLY before anything was written) added 2,366 rows and re-synced 9,820 cells.
//
// What this spec pins is the OUTCOME on his board, not the pull.
