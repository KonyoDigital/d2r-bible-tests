/**
 * Site-wide HTTP Basic Auth gate (Konyo + cousins, private personal tool).
 *
 * Runs on EVERY request to the Pages project. Only the PASSWORD matters — any
 * username is accepted — so there's a single secret to share. The password lives
 * in the Cloudflare env var SITE_PASS (a secret, never in the repo); if it's not
 * set the gate is OPEN (fail-safe so a missing secret never locks the site out).
 *
 * EXCEPTION: /api/tz is left open so the Telegram alert bot's 5-min recorder ping
 * (which sends no credentials) keeps the 48h history filling 24/7, and the public
 * TZ data stays reachable. Everything else — the bible, art, /api/intake — is gated.
 * The bible page calls /api/intake same-origin, so the browser auto-sends the
 * logged-in credentials; only outside visitors are blocked.
 *
 * VISIT LOG (2026-06-22): every authenticated load of the app page is recorded to
 * the TZ_HISTORY KV store under a `visit:` key (time, IP, city/country, device,
 * login name). View it at /visits?k=<VISITS_KEY>. Logging is best-effort and fully
 * wrapped — it can never delay or block a response (see recordVisit()).

/**
 * v3387 — THE DURABLE WEB-PRESENCE KEY, so presence is ONE read instead of two that disagree.
 *
 * Konyo, 2026-09-20: "make sure to join them so there is not mismatch and unsycn between them
 * so they match and work as a one visual read."
 *
 * THE MISMATCH IT CLOSES, stated plainly. THE FLEET reports `lastseen:<machine>` — the console
 * APP beaconing. A browser page-view of /d2r/ lands in `visit:<ms>:<rand>` and is visible only
 * at /visits. So a person who opened the bible six hours ago reads on the fleet rail as last
 * seen whenever their console app last ran, which can be days earlier. MEASURED 2026-09-19/20:
 * Dean's row said 26h while Konyo had watched him on the site that evening. Both numbers were
 * correct. The surface implied they were the same number, and that is the whole defect.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY A NEW KEY AND NOT A SCAN OF `visit:`. The login name lives in the visit VALUE, so
 * grouping page-views by person means reading every one of them. functions/api/console.js
 * already carries the scar from doing exactly that: "Reading all 2,556 values blew the
 * per-invocation subrequest cap and 500'd the page." One durable key per web identity is the
 * same shape `lastseen:` uses against the same problem, and it costs a handful of reads.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS WRITE-THROTTLED. A page-view is cheap to trigger — a reload loop would bill a KV
 * write every time — so the key is rewritten only when the stored stamp is older than
 * WEBSEEN_FLOOR_MS. Worst case per person: 12 writes an hour.
 *
 * 'webseen:' collides with no prefix in use here ('console:', 'consolelog:', 'lastseen:',
 * 'visit:') and is a string-prefix of none of them.

 * reads as absent — the very failure this key exists to end. [[unknown-stays-unknown]]
