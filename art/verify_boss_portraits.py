"""v1643 — guard the TWELVE boss portraits against being silently swapped again, and guard the ONE
remaining deliberate refusal (pit — an area farm, not a boss) against being silently "fixed".

v1643 also made this file a GATE instead of a document: it now runs from hooks/pre-push, so a
push that breaks the manifest/app agreement is blocked. It sat in the repo with ZERO automated
callers — never in pre-push, never in any of the eight CI workflows, never in package.json or
tests/ — passing its own hand-run and guarding nothing (REG-130).

WHAT THIS DOES AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IT DOES NOT DO.

It compares the bytes on disk against art/boss_portraits.manifest.json, which records the sha256 of
each portrait AS A HUMAN LAST OPENED IT, next to a sentence saying what that human saw. That is the
whole trick. The hash proves nothing about content; it proves only "these are still the bytes
somebody looked at". A CHANGED verdict is therefore not a failure — it is a request for a person to
open the image and either bless the new pixels or restore the old ones.

Why the bar is that low: art/mephisto_graphic.png shipped as a blue soulstone gem and
art/diablo_graphic.png as a leather-bound book from v269 (2026-06-14) to v1636 (2026-08-04), and
EVERY automated check passed for seven weeks. The path resolved. naturalWidth was > 0. An md5 sweep
of art/ found zero duplicates. File size flagged Mephisto at 10KB and sailed straight past Diablo at
46KB, which was a book. v1629 then "fixed" the bug by confirming the filename in the map. A file
that loads is not a file that is right, and no checker that never opens an image can tell you which
you have — so this one does not pretend to.

The cause was a fuzzy base-item matcher in v269 that rewrote 230 art/*_graphic.png files from item
art and had no idea that two of its slugs, 'mephisto' and 'diablo', name BOSSES as well as items
(Mephisto's Soulstone; a tome). Those two filenames are permanently ambiguous. Anything that bulk-
writes art/ by name must skip them, and this script is how the next bulk write gets caught.

    python3 art/verify_boss_portraits.py          # exit 0 all match, 1 something changed/missing
    python3 art/verify_boss_portraits.py --list   # print the human descriptions, check nothing

To re-bless a portrait: OPEN IT, decide in words what it depicts, then update 'depicts', 'bytes' and
'sha256' for that row in the manifest. Editing the hash without opening the image reintroduces
exactly the bug this file exists to prevent.

    The hash check answers "are these the bytes a human opened?". It cannot answer "is the app
    still serving them?", and those are different questions: v1624 had ten correct portraits sitting
    in art/ and served an ITEM map instead. So this reads the real map. It is a deliberately dumb
    key:'file' scan of the one `var BOSS_PORTRAIT = { ... };` block — the block is hand-written and
    one entry per key, and a parser clever enough to handle anything else would also be clever
    enough to be wrong quietly. Returns {} if the block is not found, which the caller treats as a
    FAILURE rather than as a pass; a null result is never a passing result.
